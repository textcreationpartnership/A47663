            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two Inſtruments of Art which are ſerviceable to the profit and uſe of men, <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> by which all things are wont to be confirmed, and eſtabliſhed. For by theſe, Phyſick it ſelf, and other Sciences, for the moſt part, beſides Mathematicall Arts, are ſupported. But ſuch things as are to gain credit with men of an exact and ſearching Judgment, ought to be proved by the Line, yea, to be examined by the Touch-stone. But what great thing can a Phyſitian undertake, if he endeavoureth by Reaſon to convince, that hearbs and Medicaments have ſtrong effects, unleſſe he could prove it by Experience? On the contrary, with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence could he truſt a triall, which for the moſt part the undiſcreet teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of practicall Phyſitians, doth declare to be deceitfull and dangerous, applyed without Judgment, unleſſe Reaſon doth aſsiſt him? And although he might be accounted a Sophiſter, to try reaſon by a proof contrary to the declaration of experience; and any one of ſound Judgment, and that doth conſider the delight of things, will never agree to the tryall, or abide to prove it raſhly, unleſſe it be approved and underpropped by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in every particular: Yet I cannot deny, or gainſay, but there are
<pb facs="tcp:53844:3"/>many hidden and ſecret things in nature, of an hidden and unknown effect, that it would be undiſcreet to attempt to declare the reaſon and cauſe of the effect of ſuch things. Theſe very things are called by <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 34.</note> deſtitute of reaſon, and bereft of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of cauſes, which do not preſent a manifeſt demonſtration to the ſenſe and underſtanding,<note place="margin">Occultae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietates.</note> and therefore are called by Phyſitians, hidden quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But if they perceive any thing of this kind to interpoſe us, either by the courſe of the Stars, and moving of the glittering ſignes, or by the divine will, or by Concretion and mixture of the elements: or laſtly, by the force of the whole ſubſtance, and the particular form, which we cannot attain to by the Reaſon and Judgment of the mind, we caſt thoſe things into the hidden eſsence and ſecret properties, and by ſuch refuge we do eſcape and deliver our ſelves out of that Labyrinth. But I, whereby I might ſtir up the minds of the learned to ſearch out the demonſtrations and cauſes of things of this nature, will to the uttermoſt of my power endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to draw out the reaſon by a probable and artificial conjecture, or as near hand as I can by levelling to hit the mark. I confeſſe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in nature of an unknown original, wrapped up in abundance of difficulty, whereof notwithstanding a probable reaſon may be deviſed, and the cauſe of the effect might be ſhewed very likely, if not apparently, and clearly. For example: The Baſilisk doth kill a man by his ſight. Who that is exerciſed in the works of nature doth not know it to happen out of the hurtfull breath that proceeds from him, which by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he breatheth forth ſecretly to the deſtruction of man. Yet neither the Baſilisk onely, but almoſt all kind of Wild beaſts is hurtfull to man, and doth rejoyce to bring deſtruction by breath, and hiſsing. So the ſight of a Woolf, if he can but come near a man, doth cauſe hoarſeneſſe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in a manner taketh away his voice by the gaping of his mouth, and his venemous breath. So the Feminine Sex having their Monthly terms flowing from them, do make dusk the brightneſse of Ivory, and a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe; doth blunt the edge of a Sword, doth choak the Corn; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the breath doth kill the hearbs of the garden, and ſhe doth not onely deform every one that ſhe meets, but her own ſelf with ſpots and blemiſhes. By the ſame reaſon the eyes being corrupted with blearey'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, redneſſe in the eyes, or bloud-ſhot, doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to corrupt the eyes of others. Which <hi>Ovid</hi> doth expreſſe in a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſimilitude, and <hi>Juvenal, Satyr. 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>When Eyes diſtinctly view thoſe that are ſore,</l>
               <l>The more they look, they hurt themſelves the more.</l>
               <l>And many things the body do infect</l>
               <l>By meer tranſition. Soth' ſcab of one, effects</l>
               <l>A filthy ſcurf in the whole flock i'th' field,</l>
               <l>Cattel, heards, Oxen, to the ſame muſt yield;</l>
               <l>And ſo a Grape regarded ſolemnly,</l>
               <l>Doth draw a colour from a Grape that's nigh.</l>
            </q>
            <pb facs="tcp:53844:3"/>
            <p>But men do breath forth the greateſt infection to men, where they ſtand juſt oppoſite, for it doth not bring ſo great evill, and infect with ſo great corruption, if the breath doth bend overthwart, or if it happen to paſſe away on the right or left ſide. For as the tranſverſe, or oblique ſight, as it is wont to be with ſuch as have rowling or are dimſighted, ſometimes do wax dull and dim: ſo theſe things which flow from the eyes, and any other part of the body, if they are carried obliquely, it hapneth that they are repreſſed and grow dull, and bring leſſe evill to thoſe that ſtand by. Which very thing I more diligently obſerve, when I go to aſſiſt thoſe that are ſick of a contagious diſeaſe, ſo that when I talk with them I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies turned away, <hi>never ſtanding between the Chimney and he that keepeth his bed.</hi> This breathing and flowing out, although it doth not preſent it ſelf to our eyes, and leſſe declared to our ſeeing ſenſe, yet it bears it ſelf into our noſtrills, ears, brain, vocall artery, and the ſtrings of the lungs. So I have obſerved ſome with ſuch a ſtinking damp and ſtrong ſmelling breath, that unleſſe you stand farther off they would ſtrike every one that they meet, with the contagion of their breath, and kill them. But every one may perceive how largely the breath of living creatures may ſtretch it ſelf, how far a contagious diſeaſe may extend it ſelf, eſpecially in the Winter ſeaſon. But becauſe of the thickneſſe and groſsneſs of the Ayre, the breath ſmoking out of the moſt inward bowels by a certain retiring as we ſee the flowing and ebbing of the Ocean to break forth and dilate it ſelf all abroad: which although it be not plainly perceived in Summer daies, and is leſs preſented to the eyes, yet thou doſt perceive it, either by ſmell, or doſt apprehend the hidden poyſon in thy inmoſt bowells. And as theſe very things work deſtruction to the body, and bring in deadly poyſon, ſo ſweet ſmells and fragrant hearbs do ſtir up the ſpirits, and do cheriſh and recreate the heart it ſelf the fountain of life. Which even any one of a dull Judgment can perceive, when he ſeeth the ſtrength weakened by ſwounding, and faſt a ſleep by the defect of the mind, to be reſtored and ſtirred up by ſweet ſmells. But theſe mean things being let alone afterwards by the aſſiſtance of the moſt high God, I will relate more ſecret things. For which if I ſhall ſeem to any one to have wholly ſearched out the ſecrets of nature, and the uſes under weak and very unconſtant reaſons, and a very ſmall proportion of judgment, and with no trimmed ſentences, to have furniſhed nature with no ſtore; I would deſire him to be perſwaded, that I rather afford and demonſtrate matter of writing to the learned, then take it up before hand. But I have attempted, and undertaken to handle thoſe things, not with ſo great hope, and confidence of accompliſhing it, as deſire and will to try it, and alſo that I might the better deſerve of my Advocate, and that I might more oblige my Citizens by this ſervice. But after <hi>Plato, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> doth ſtir up to attempt things of this kind, and doth deſire that this ſhould be paid to our Countrey and Citizens as a due benevolence. For ſo he doth prick us up to the conſideration of things, to the ſtudy of vertue, to ſearth out thoſe things which are profitable to men.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:53844:4"/>
            <q>
               <l>O wretched men, ye ought to learn and ſhow</l>
               <l>The cauſe of things, and what we are to known,</l>
               <l>Or to what end we're made on earth to live,</l>
               <l>What order, or what bounds doth nature give</l>
               <l>To gentle-ſliding Rivers, and what meaſure,</l>
               <l>Of ſilver, or what's lawfull to wiſh for pleaſure,</l>
               <l>What good doth money afford, how much we owe,</l>
               <l>Unto our Country, and what we ſhould beſtow</l>
               <l>On neighbours, what direction God doth give,</l>
               <l>To thee, how thou in humane things doſt live.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Therefore I will try, what I can perform, or wherein I can go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; if I do not proceed in every thing exactly, I may beg pardon for my fault; and ſo much the more juſtly, becauſe the argument of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Work is ſo great, and doth ſtretch it ſelf forth ſo unmeaſurably, ſo that it requires infinite labour, and no mean Witt to accompliſh every thing exactly,<note place="margin">The chief City of <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> in <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſus.</hi>
               </note> and adorn that * <hi>Sparta</hi> for its honour and amplitude. Which if <hi>Horace</hi> in a homely, and very eaſie argument,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doth pardon faults, which want of care doth cauſe, Or are neglected by humane Nature's Laws:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By how much the more is it convenient to wink at and keep ſilent most things in ſo great difficulties, and not to cut every thing (as 'tis ſaid) to the quick. For it can ſcarcely be expreſsed, how great wearineſſe is to be born patiently by Phyſitians, what labours are to be undergone, what troubles, complaints, and bewailing ſpeeches, are to be endured at home and abroad, when they follow their own affairs, and diligently employ their aſsiſtance to their Citizens: when all their ſtudy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry doth conſiſt in action, their no leſſe troubleſome then gainful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice doth ſuffer no liberty, no time to take breathe; ſo that when they me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on thoſe things that were diſpatched in borrowed hours, (that is) in convenient ſervice, they are ſcarce at leiſure to write them, much leſse to make them perfect. Which when it daily happeneth true, and theſe kind of occupations do continually environ me at home and abroad, all things ſcarcely, and very hardly, could be perfected according to my mind; but when the conſideration of Nature did onely delight me, neither a more acceptable Argument could be thought upon, it ſeemed good to me, to write of its Miracles more at large, and make all the Works of Nature more known.</p>
            <p>Wherefore after I had dedicated theſe four Books of the <hi>Miracles of Nature,</hi> to <hi>ERICUS</hi> King of <hi>Swedland,</hi> the most invincible token of this New Year, I do purpoſe to adde Two of the ſame Argument in ſhort, whereby the most Serene King having brought to an end, and quieted the War, (which he undertook by Sea and Land againſt ſome conſpiring Enemies, by moſt excellent vertue, and the greatneſſe and
<pb facs="tcp:53844:4"/>courage of an high and invincible Mind,) might be refreſhed more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly by the Contemplation of Nature and Things. Having required this of <hi>William Simonds</hi> a Printer of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> that he would bring theſe honourable and notable examples into the favour of the King's Court, and of the deſirous Reader; which when he promiſed to accompliſh, and very truly performed by the induſtry of <hi>Chriſtopher Plantin,</hi> I think to finiſh the reſt ſuddenly, if it be ſo that no hindrance happen, and our Heavenly Father grant constant and durable health; For I hope it will be ſo, that ſome new thing will come forth at the next <hi>Franckford</hi> Mart, whereby at length the ſtudious Reader may delight himſelf. For Newes and Delight is the encouragement and allurement of Reading and Learning, eſpecially where the thing is declared very evidently, and with convenient words, and ſerious things are mixt with merry, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable with ſweet and pleaſant; which very thing I have ſtudied to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, according to my power, by that moderation of practice, that I may no where digreſse from comelineſse, no where paſſe beyond the limits of honeſty.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is.</note>
                     <hi>Nature is the Mind or Divine Reaſon, the Efficient of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral works, and the preſerver of things that be.</hi> Which power can be aſcribed to none elſe but God, and to Chriſt who is inſeparably uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him. For, <hi>He is the brightneſſe of his Fathers Glory,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. <hi>1.</hi> John <hi>1.</hi> God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in himſelf the cauſe of all things.</note> 
                     <hi>and the expreſſe Image of his ſubſtance;</hi> and he is the Maker of Nature, and of all the Univerſe; and at his beck, without any matter, he created all things, and in him is the life and vigour of things created, and from him is there a living quality infuſed into all things; That is, by him every thing ſubſiſts in its natural force,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Coloſ. 1.</hi> Nature is neither fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nor idle.</note> by an inſet faculty propagates and maintains it ſelf: there is nothing in ſo great an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe that is barren or idle, nothing was made raſhly, or by chance, or in vain. Every Plant hath its imbred vertue; there is given to every living creature its own diſpoſition, and natural inclination. In a word, whatſoever is contain'd within the compaſſe of the world and of the Heavens, is indued with an imbred force for its peculiar operations, and all things are diſpoſed in their places and times, and by an admirable viciſcitude, they all perform their offices and courſes. Wherefore when God the Efficient and Moderator of ſo great a gift, had view'd all things that he had made in ſix dayes, they ſeemed to him exceeding good: That is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</note> ſo wrought as art could require, as the order and ſeries of things could demand, that all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53844:10"/>things might ſerve for uſe, and tend to that end they were ordained. Whereof <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems to ſpeak wiſely in theſe very words:<note place="margin">De part. Ani. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>There is nothing in Nature ſo ſmall or contemptible, that may not make men in ſome things to wonder at it.</hi> And what men report that <hi>Hieraclitus Tarentinus</hi> ſaid, when he turned aſide into a Bakers houſe; <hi>Enter, here are the Gods alſo;</hi> the ſame muſt we ſuppoſe of Natures works. For in the ſmalleſt works of Nature the Diety ſhines forth, and all things are good and beautifull. For this is an adjunct to the works of Nature, that nothing is done raſhly or by chance, but for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain end. And as when we talk of Houſes magnificently built, we ſpeak not of the Lime, or of Bricks, or Wood, and the other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, but of the form and ſhape, and ſtructure of the Edifices, and for what purpoſe they were built;<note place="margin">An Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from Buildings.</note> ſo he that ſearcheth into the works of Nature, he diſcourſeth not of the matter, but of the form and of the whole ſubſtance, and finally the uſe and profit. So the body was made for the Soul, but the limbs for the offices they are to perform conveniently, and to fulfill their functions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">For what uſe &amp; End Man was Created.</note>But Man was brought upon the ſtage of this world for Gods cauſe, who ought to take pleaſure in him, and acknowledge his bounty, may repoſe himſelf in God, truſt in him, and reſt upon him. In therefore ſo great multitude and variety of Things exiſting, we muſt not onely admire the force of Nature and Efficience, but his Majeſty and Immenſity from whom all things are produced and do proceed, and by whoſe bounty the works of Nature ſubſiſt, and are kept from corruption.

And, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, By the memory of things, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of Invention, and quickneſſe of motion, and by the exceeding beauty of Vertue we know the force of the Mind, though we cannot ſee it with our eyes; ſo we perceive God, and that eternal Mind clearly by the works he hath made,<note place="margin">How God is known to Man.</note> and effectually do we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his force and influence; for his vertue is diffuſed through all things,<note place="margin">

And I ſhall do this the more accurately, becauſe there are ſome Bawds in our Countrey that would perſwade women that Mothers afford very little to the generation of the child, but onely are at the trouble to carry it, and muſt endure the tedious time of nine Moneths,<note place="margin">Women do much in procteati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> as if the womb were hired by men, as Merchants ſhips are to be fraited by them; and to diſcharge their burden.

                     <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith, that ſometime when the mans ſeed falls on the left ſide of the womb, a male child is begotten: But becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is perfected in that part of the womb that is ordain'd for the procreation of females, there will be ſomething in it that is but half man, and will be fairer, and whiter or ſmoother and leſſe hairy than is convenient for a man to be, or the voice will be ſmall, and ſharp, or the chin will be bare and bald, and the courage will be leſſe.<note place="margin">Whence is the name <hi>Virago?</hi>
                     </note> Again, if the ſeed be caſt into the right ſide of the womb, it may be a girle may be begotten; but becauſe ſhe is conceived in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53844:14"/>the place ordained for the male, ſhe will be more viraginous than ordinary women, as having ſtrong limbs, very tall, a ſwart counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,<note place="margin">What wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is moſt imperious.</note> a hairy chin, a ruder face, a ſtrong voyce, and a bold and man-like courage: whence it falls out, that ſuch women will caſt off the yoke, and rule over men, and will take ſo much power to themſelves in governing, that men dare not ſpeak or ſtir for them. Though theſe things and many more might be alledged for the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the form, which are very probable, and for the moſt part they ſo fall out; yet the principal cauſe of this effect ſeems to me to conſiſt in the tacite Imagination of the woman. For if ſhe conceive in her mind, or do by chance faſten her eyes upon any object, and imprint that in her Mind, the child commonly doth repreſent that in the outward parts.<note place="margin">The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination what it doth.</note> So whileſt the Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Embrace, if the woman think of the mans countenance, and look upon him, or thinks of any one elſe, that likeneſſe will the child repreſent. For ſuch is the power of Imagination, that when the woman doth intentively behold any thing, ſhe will produce ſomething like that ſhe beheld, ſo it falls out, that children have the forms of divers things upon them, as Warts, Spots, Moles, Daſhes, which cannot eaſily be wiped off, or taken away. So ſome of our women ſeeing a Hare, bring forth a child with a Hare-lip;<note place="margin">Hare-lip.</note> ſo ſome children are born with flat Noſes, wry mouths, great bubber lips, and ill ſhaped of all the body, becauſe the woman when ſhe conceived the child, and in the time ſhe was big of it, had her eyes and mind buſied upon ſome monſtrous creature.<note place="margin">Art can change the ſhape and colour of Animals.</note> Men uſe to effect the like by art in other creatures, ſetting before them when they are to conceive the colours of divers things.</p>

Hence it is, that a woman may cauſe her Child to have a ſtrange form, and nothing like to the father.

But there is much in this, whether Venery be uſed with great or weak deſire. For many are leſſe venereous, and not ſo hot, and do not with any great deſire uſe copulation, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decline from it; and that they may pacifie their wives, they pay their due benevolence (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it) very faintly and drowſily;<note place="margin">3 Cor. 7.</note> whence it happens, that the Child falls ſhort of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents nature, manners, and imbred generoſity; and hence it is, that wiſe men ſometimes beget ſtupid ſlothful Children,<note place="margin">Why wiſe men ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beget fools.</note> and that are of a feeble mind, becauſe they are not much given to theſe delights. But when the Progenitors are hot in venereous actions, and do libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and abundantly employ themſelves therein, it oft-times hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the children are of the ſame manners, deſires, and actions of mind that their Parents are.<note place="margin">A Simile from Birds.</note> For as Birds are of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with thoſe they are bred from, and are of the ſame colour'd

For from the fathers ſeed and the mothers blood many things uſe to deſcend to poſterity; for the ſame force and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that is in the Parents ſperm is poured forth into the children, as from one veſſel into another.

So the Leproſie, Epilepſie, feet-gowt, hand-gowt, and other diſeaſes and defects are hereditary. And becauſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood is the chief nutriment for the Child,<note place="margin">Women de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive moſt part of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the children.</note> and the ſecondary beginning of procreation, it oft-times happens, that Children take more miſchief from the Mother, whether you conſider their bodies or minds. So wicked drunken fooliſh women commonly with us bring forth juſt ſuch Children, and that are ſubject to the ſame vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Mothers fault doth more wrong to Children, if ſhe be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53844:16"/>and play the whore, than the Fathers fault doth; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if ſhe be given to drunkenneſſe or any other vice. For if a man of ripe years, or when he is young and unmarried ſhould get a Maid ☞ with child, he deſerves almoſt to be commended for it, and not to be diſgraced. For it is commonly ſaid, that one may ſafely marry his daughter to ſuch a man, who is not unfruitful and barren, but hath proof of his Manhood already in getting of a child. But if a woman or a maid that is marriageable ſhould do the like, or ſuffer any ſuch matter to be done, when ſhe begins to fall in love, ſhe would ſo loſe her reputation and honour, that no Cobler nor any mean fellow whatſoever but would ſcorn to marry her; and if one ſhould marry her, he would quickly hit her in the teeth with her whoredome. So as ſoon as any maid is overcome, and hath loſt her maidenhead, and thoſe cloyſters of Virginity are entred, that fault can never be waſht away, nor can thoſe cloſets be ever lockt again. For ſo the Poet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it,

                        <l>Can never be regain'd.</l>
                     </q> So <hi>Plautus</hi> in <hi>Amphitruo.</hi> I do not think that to be the dowry which people call ſo, but chaſtity and baſhfulneſſe, and a moderate deſire, a fear of the Gods, love of Parents, and concord with kindred. Wherefore beſides others,<note place="margin">Ecclus.</note> that wiſe Hebrew doth earneſtly warn Parents, that they ſhould be very careful to look to their daughters chaſtity and honeſty, that they may not be polluted with wicked company, or be ſtained by them. For women-kind are naturally frail, and more ſubject to be abuſed. Since therefore there are many things that hinder manners and good life, as alſo there are many things that defile the body and the decent frame thereof, care muſt be had that nothing may pollute the mind with ill manners, or diſgrace the body by any monſtrous deformity. And becauſe the beauty and decent form of the body is very acceptacle to all Men, we ſhould obſerve exactly by the progreſſe of natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, what things will make one beautiful, or deformed and ugly, ſince theſe things principally conſiſt in womens Imagination, and in ſuch things as proceed from without, care muſt be had, that that Sex may ſee nothing,<note place="margin">A woman with child is ſubject to paſsions.</note> that may move their mind to think abſurdly, which in framing the child may bring any hurt. For if any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief happen from without, if any fear or trembling fall on them when they meet any terrible thing, preſently all this fright falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the child, the natural ſpirits and humours being turn'd thither, and all the faculties of the woman are buſied in framing ſuch a thing. For a vehement and fixed cogitation whileſt it doth toſſe the vehement ſpecies of things, and turns them often over, it doth imprint that form and figure which it ſo often thinks on, upon the Child. For the confluence of the internal ſpirit and humours paints out the Image of the thing thought on.<note place="margin">Whence comes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of body.</note> It is not for nothing, and for no cauſe, that ſome have ſuch ill ſhapen bodies, ill and uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruel countenances, ſwoln blabber'd cheeks, wry mouthes, wide

For by reaſon of want of heat, flegmatique humours are leſſe concocted. Hence it is that winds and often bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings frequently trouble Women. Of kin to this is the daintineſſe of Women, wherewith men and Feavouriſh people are oft troubled. But child-bearing Women that are tempted with this diſeaſe, are ſo inſatiable in their deſire, that if they cannot obtain what they long for, they bring both themſelves and their Child in danger of death.<note place="margin">Mayſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men long for ſtrong things.</note> This diſeaſe for the moſt part troubles the Low Country Women, becauſe they are of moyſt cold conſtitutions, and feed on ill Nouriſhment. There have been ſome in our dayes that when they ſaw a corpulent well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>t out a part with her teeth, and chewd it a little, and then ſhe ſwallowed it raw. When ſhe was not yet ſatisfied, ſhe deſired to bite again, but the man would not endure her. But ſhe preſently began to languiſh, and to be delivered. She brought forth Twins, the one living, and the other dead for want of a ſecond
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53844:17"/>bite. I can ſee no other reaſon for it, than that the woman grieving in her mind, the vitall ſpirits are leſsned,<note place="margin">A Woman with child ſuffers if her longing be demed her.</note> and the humours appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to nouriſh the child, turn another way, and are not carried to the womb; ſo the child wanting the food which the mother longed for, grows feeble and dies. For when the paſſages and receptacles whereby food uſeth to be derived to the Matrix, are ſtopped, it muſt needs follow that the child will want nutriment and die. But if the teeming woman be ſtrong of nature, and knows how to moderate her paſſions, the child doth not die, but grows ſickly. By theſe you may ſee abundantly what a womans Imagination can do, and what outward objects conceived in the mind can print upon the child that is then to be formed.<note place="margin">When we muſt pleaſe ſick people with diet.</note> Wherefore I ſuppoſe they do not much tranſgreſſe the bounds of Art that are not ſo rigid, but do ſometimes indulge to ſick people ſuch meat as they long for, though they are not ſo proper for them, in caſe they are ſuch as will bring no great hurt to their bodies, for ſometimes by ſuch manner of diet we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell Chronical and long diſeaſes: So when ſick people are vexed with laſting diſeaſes, I do not uſe to be very obſtinate or refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt them, in granting to them ſuch meats as they greedily deſire and earneſtly intreat for, when they earneſtly ask for them, and eat them with a great Appetite. For by this means it comes to paſſe that natural heat is ſtirred up, and the imbred faculties are moved, humours that ſtick in the body are concocted, and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the paſſages being opened. And by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> example ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I ſtudy to gratify my Patients, and to be ſilent and wink at them, if they take what may not greatly hurt their bodies. For as he ſaith; <hi>Something worſe meat and drink, ſo it pleaſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L. 2. <hi>Aph.</hi> 38.</note> 
                     <hi>is better than that which is better and pleaſeth not ſo well.</hi> For all thoſe things that reliſh beſt in the Palate, and are moſt pleaſing to the taſte, are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily concocted, and nouriſh more, becauſe the ſtomach takes them in greedily, and likes them beſt.<note place="margin">Deſire makes all ſweet.</note> So I know ſome that have cured Quartans, and wandring Agues, by eating raw Herrings new taken out of the Sea: So in deſperate diſeaſes that are come to the height of their danger, I do not much fear that greedy appetite, nor do I contend with or deny to them that deſire ſuch things, what they would have; but uſing choice, and preſcribing them the way and manner how to dreſſe them, I let them uſe their own deſire ſo far as I am confident it will not hurt them, and I conjecture the diſeaſe may be batter'd by it. For by this acrimony and greedineſſe of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, the force of nature is ſharpned and ſet forward, that was before aſleep, and ſo regaining ſtrength, it ſets upon the diſeaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh.

                     <note place="margin">It is proved by reaſon, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wants not Seed.</note>THough the Seed of Man be the chief efficient, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of action, motion, and generation; yet that a woman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords ſeed, and doth effectually lend help to the procreation of the Child is evinced by ſtrong reaſons. Firſt, ſeminary veſſels had been given them in vain, and genital teſticles; if a woman wanted ſeminal excrement, ſhe ſhould afford very little to the child, and ſhould have no part in it. But ſince that nature doth nothing in vain, it muſt needs be, that they were made for uſe of ſeed and for procreation, and placed in their proper places, both the Teſticles and the receptacles of ſeed, whoſe nature &amp; force is to afford fruitfull vertue to the ſeed. And to prove this, there needs no ſtronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than this, that if women do not uſe copulation to caſt out their ſeed they oft-times fall into great diſeaſes and cruel ſymptoms.<note place="margin">The danger of ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</note> For you ſhall ſee many Widows for want of husbands, and Virgins ready for Marriage, when they do not marry in time, though their terms keep their orderly ſeaſons, yet are they cruelly tormented with fainting fits, and ſtrangling of the Mother. For all are of opinion, that more harm comes to them by the ſeed being corrupted, than by their courſes being ſtopt. For the ſeed growes to be of a veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous quality, hence ariſeth that ſwarth weaſil colour in Maids when they begin to be in love: hence comes their ſhort breathings, tremblings, and pantings of the heart, the expulſive faculty being moved to caſt out the ſwelling humour.<note place="margin">Maids to be married in time.</note> If ſuch luſty Widows or Maids in years happen to be married, that their ſeed by the uſe of man may be ejected, you ſhall preſently ſee them look freſh as a Roſe, and to be very amiable and pleaſant, and not ſo crabbid and teſty, eſpecially if their husbands be men for their turn, and can give them their due.<note place="margin">Maids by Marriage gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if the man lye but ſeldom with his wife, or the man be ſlow in doing his office, you ſhall ſee the houſe turn'd upſide down; for ſome of this Sex are ſo greedy of copulation, that you may weary them, but never ſatisfie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53844:18"/>them: which ſeems to me the chief cauſe why a woman in copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth afford ſeed, and hath more pleaſure than a man hath: For ſince by nature infinite delight accompanies the ejecting of the ſeed by the breaking forth of the ſwelling ſpirits, and the ſtiffneſſe of the nerves, and the woman performs a double office,<note place="margin">The woman deſires man as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth the form.

Hence it is that the Child is commonly more like the mother than the Father, becauſe the Mothers confer moſt in generation; and it is proved, becauſe women love the Children beſt. For beſides their ejecting of ſeed, all the time they are great with child, they nouriſh the Child with their pureſt blood. I find <hi>Galen</hi> to be of that mind, for he thinks that the child receives ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more from the Mother than from the Father;<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de ſem.</note> and he refers the difference of Sex to the affluence of menſtruall blood; but the reaſon of likeneſſe to the force of the ſeed.<note place="margin">A Simile from Plants and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> For as plants receive more from fruitfull ground, than they do from the Induſtry of the Husbandman; ſo the Infant receives all things more plentifully from the Mother: For firſt, the ſeed of them both is foſter'd and heaped together in the womb, then it growes up with the Mothers blood, and increaſeth by degrees ſecretly.

So many others have pray'd to God for a Child to be their Heir in their Eſtates, and God hath granted them their requeſt. None can doubt but this is Gods work, and theſe things have a peculiar effect from the divine Will. But we ſhall ſpeak of things that proceed from natural cauſes, and that nature uſeth to work by her imbred force. For ſhe prepares a body fit for the Souls condition, and gives every thing its temper. But ſince there are two principles out of which the body of man is made, and which make the Child like the progenitors,<note place="margin">The force of ſeed.</note> and to be of this or that Sex; Seed, common to both ſexes; and Menſtrual blood, proper to the woman: The ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude conſiſts in the force of the male or female feed, ſo that it proves like to the one or the other, as the ſeed is more plentifully afforded by one or the other.<note place="margin">The force of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruall blood.</note> which belongs onely to the woman. For, were that force in the ſeed, ſince the mans ſeed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53844:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>is alwaies ſtronger and hotter than the womans, children would be all boyes. Wherefore the kind of the creature is attributed to the Temperament of the active qualities, which conſiſt in heat and cold, and to the ſubſtance or nature of the matter under them; that is, to the flowing of the menſtrual blood. Now the ſeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords both force to beget and form the child, and matter for its generation: alſo in the menſtrual blood there is both matter and force. For as the ſeed moſt helps to the material principle, ſo doth the menſtrual blood to the potential. Seed is, ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> de ſem.</note> blood well concocted by the veſſels that contain it, ſo that blood is not onely the matter of generating the child, but it is alſo ſeed in poſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if the material principle of generation, according to which the ſex is made, were onely in the menſtrual blood, then ſhould all children be girles; as if all the efficient force were in the ſeed, they would all be boys. But ſince both have both principles, and in menſtrual blood, matter predominates in quantity, and in the ſeed force and vertue; deſervedly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith <hi>Galen,</hi> the child receives its ſex rather from the Mother than from the Father, though his ſeed do afford ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the material principles, but more weakly. But ſimilitude, though Imagination be of great force therein, is referred rather to the Father than the Mother; for there is more force in the mans ſeed. But the womans ſeed receiving faculty from the menſtruall blood for 9. moneths, doth as much exceed the man's, as the man's did the woman at firſt copulation. For it is proper to the womans ſeed, to ſtrengthen and increaſe her own ſubſtance more than the mans. So the woman not onely affords matter to make the Child, but force and vertue to perfect the conception, though the womans ſeed be fit nutriment for the mans feed by reaſon of the moyſture and thinneſſe of it, and is more fit to frame and make up the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby. For as of ſoft running wax, and moyſt clay,<note place="margin">A Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from wax and moyſt clay.</note> the workman can work what he will with his hand; ſo the man's feed mixed with the womans ſeed, and the menſtruall blood, helps ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to make the form, and perfects the parts of a man. Or if you would have a compariſon of theſe things from Natural things; as the Earth is to plants, ſo is the womb for conception.<note place="margin">A compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Earth and the Womb.</note> For as the ſeeds of Plants need the Earth, to nouriſh and increaſe them; ſo the ſeed of man requires the womb, which is affected with a deſire of an off ſpring. For by the moyſture thereof, and by blood running forth at the veins to water the child, it doth grow and increaſe. Hence you may conjecture what art nature uſeth in conceiving and framing a child, which by an innate force growes up by degrees, and ſecretly increaſing comes to its full ſtrength; wherein I think that worth the Enquiry, by what force the nature of the woman makes a man or a woman; what faculty ſeems to be aſcribed rather
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53844:20"/>to the woman than to the man, by reaſon of more matter coming from her, which conſiſts in the blood and ſeed of the woman; whereby the Child all the time it is in the womb is nouriſhed and increaſed. For as mans ſeed is the chief cauſe of motion, and the Inſtrument and Artificer, whereby Man is made; yet the womans ſeed with the plenty of her menſtrual blood affords more matter than the man doth, and by help thereof the child is perfected, and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed for its ſex; for that is it makes a child a male or a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</p>

                  <p>THe Nature of Man and his parts deſtinated to the Generation of man, if they be rightly diſpoſed, and there be no defect in them, will beget a perfect man. But if they be defective, or faulty, or the feed be confuſedly mixed,<note place="margin">Whence come Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> or the principles of Generation be otherwiſe involved than they ſhould be, it falls out that prodigious and monſtrous births are made. Some fay that theſe things happen from the influence and aſpects of the Stars, and as juſt judgments for ſins. And I think it very conſonant to truth. For they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happen from a faulty conſtitution of the Womb, from filthy corrupt ſeed,<note place="margin">A ſimile from Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> and diſorderly copulation.

For Marriners, which they commonly marry, when they come from long voyages, run mad upon their wives with full ſail,<note place="margin">Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Venery burts the child.</note> never regarding their menſtrual courſes, nor the Conjunction or new Moon, at which time by reaſon of their terms copulation uſeth to be hurtfull, for the ſeed cannot ſtick together, nor be fitly united with the womans blond, whence it comes to paſſe, that the ſeed either runs forth, or if it chance to ſtick together, nature cannot make up any thing rightly of a confuſed matter that ſticks not ſo as it ſhould do. And not onely the mens incontinence is to be found fault with; but alſo of the women, who having waited ſo long in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53844:20"/>their abſence, do voluntarily put themſelves upon their husbands, and ſnatch the ſeed from them as hungry dogs do a bone, or <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his bait. Whence it comes that the faculty of the Womb loſeth its force to generation and ſucceſſe of breeding a child. Or if it try to do any thing, it makes ſome monſtrous form that is nothing like to the ſhape of a man: ſometimes after three Moneths ſpace, that filthy matter runs forth, and an undigeſted heap comes out by pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as filthy water out of a Ship by the Pump. Not unlike to this is an efflux that troubles women with many heavy torments: our women, becauſe this conception begins in the fourth Moon, when ſhe is in Conjunction, by whoſe force the terms flow down, call it a Moon birth, or <hi>Manekinds.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A birth not natural is cast forth.</note> Sometimes this falſe conception is made without the help of man, by Imagination onely in thoſe that are very laſcivious, ſo as by often ſeeing their Husbands, and but touching them, the womans ſeed will mix together with the blood, and the neat of the Womb will begin to frame ſomething like to a living Creature; But the formal cauſe, the mans ſeed being wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that is like the Work-maſter, the matter the woman affords,<note place="margin">Mans ſeed is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the child.</note> obtains a ſtrange deformed ſhape: ſometimes the like is made by the help of the man, when in the ſourth and ſilent Moon he copulates with his wife, and on the fourth day after the Moons Conjunction, when her courſes run, not obſerving natures rules; for he ſtrives againſt the flux, and ſails againſt the ſtream.<note place="margin">A common proverb to piſſe againſt the Moon.</note> Our people by a Proverb call it piſſing againſt the Moon, the Latines call them, Born in the fourth Moon. Becauſe they have unhappy beginnings of their life, and had their firſt entrance by generation contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures order, whence it happens that they are very unlucky in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they undertake. For when a man lyeth with his wife that hath her courſes, he ſtops her flux, and the blood is forced back again, you may ſee the ſame in veſſels, and Cask of Wine, and by blood running from your noſe, in which we ſtop the liquor running forth by thruſting in a ſtople, or ſome rag that is wound together. Yet it is not neceſſary nor fit to ſtop the blood running forth, when as the mans ſeed mingled with ſuch filthy moiſture, cannot make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man. For the matter is naught and unfit to receive a decent and proper figure. And therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> had good reaſon, by Gods command to forbid men to lie with women during their unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.<note place="margin">Touch not a woman that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean of her blood.</note> For it can hardly be expreſſed what contagion and miſchief comes thereupon, when men do not refrain from women that are impure. For this contagion will by degrees ſeize upon the whole habit of the body, and ſecretly breeds the Leproſie and the Pox. And it doth this the ſooner, if the woman be diſeaſed of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe, as whores commonly are. For then ſhe will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently communicate her infection.<note place="margin">Whence are monſtrous ſhapes in the body and mind.</note> Wherefore no man need much admire that there are ſo many monſtrous births, or from whence come ſo many ſtrange ſhapes, that there are ſo many ſcald heads, maimed and crooked people, with bow'd and bent legs, that there are ſo many ſwellings about the fundament and the groins, ſo many Bube's, ſo many ſwoln Emrods: and as for the mind,<note place="margin">Bube's in the groins</note> that there are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53844:21"/>ſo many dull, ſtupid, forgetful, fooliſh, mad, and unreaſonable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for all proceeds from diſorderly and unſeaſonable venery, or, from the corrupt faulty ſeed of the Parents, are derived on their poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let every man Conſider how Cruel they are to their children, that bring ſuch miſchiefs upon them, and chiefly they are here underſtood that are conceived in the fourth Moon,<note place="margin">Born in the fourth Moon, cal'd commonly, Piſt againſt the Moon.</note> that is when womens courſes are upon them, at what time they ſhould not dare to copulate with men; For the children they then conceive want all thoſe gifts and properties, that children, begot at ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble times, are endowed with. They are fit for nothing that is good and vertuous; or to perform any noble actions. And if they do any thing well, they have no ſucceſſe in what they undertake, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee any proſperous end. For they are by Nature imperfect, and their natural faculties are ſhort, which help men in their buſineſſe, not by their own, but their Parents faults, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decently in procreation violated natures laws. Whence it is that many things are wanting in them, or elſe given them ſparingly and with ſome ill qualities, that others obtain bountifully; and they ſuffer no leſſe loſſe in their minds; For they want almoſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſes, and are extream dull, without that ſharpneſſe of wit, quickneſſe of Invention, counſell and prudence that others have. Informer years a woman that was an Iſlander took Phyſick of me, ſhe married a Sea-man,<note place="margin">A hiſtory of a thing done.</note> and conceived by him, her belly began to ſwell to ſuch a vaſt magnitude, that one would think it would never hold to carry the burthen. When nine Moneths were paſt, that makes three quarters of a year, the Midwife was cal'd; firſt with much a do ſhe was delivered of a rude lump, which I conceive was a ſuperfaetation after a lawfull conception, there were faſtned to it on both ſides two handles, like to arms for the length and the faſhion of them; It panted and ſeem'd to be alive, as ſponges and Sea-fiſh cal'd <hi>Viticae</hi> in Dutch <hi>Elſchowe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sea ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> which flote in the Sea in Summer in infinite numbers, and being taken out of the Sea, they run abroad, and being long handled they melt, with a burning and pricking left behind them; whence they had their name. After this a Monſter came forth of the Womb with a crooked beck, and a long round neck, with brandiſhing eyes, and a pointed tail, and it was very nimble footed. So ſoon as it came to the light, it made a fearful noyſe in the room, and ran here and there to find ſome ſecret place to hide it ſelf: at laſt the women with cuſhions fell upon it and ſtrangled it.<note place="margin">Leeches in a Womans body.</note> This kind of Monſter, becauſe like a Leech it ſucks the blood from the child, they call it a Leech, commonly a Sucker. At laſt this woman extreamly tired and almoſt ready to die, brought forth a Man-child, of which the Monſter had ſo eaten up the fleſh; that ſo ſoon as it was chriſtned, it had very little life remaining in it. But the woman hardly reſtored to her ſtrength, reported the whole truth to me, of all the pains ſhe endured; and I preſcribed unto her a wholeſome courſe of life, and to reſtore her forces, for ſhe was grown very feeble and lean. Theſe and many ſuch like things
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53844:21"/>ſhould teach all men and women to uſe all decency, and orderly proceedings in their mutual embracings,<note place="margin">Lecherous people are marked.</note> leſt Nature ſhould be wronged thereby. In which reſpect ſome laſcivious people are much to be condemned, who think they may do what they liſt when they uſe copulation, and will no wayes have their pleaſure bounded. For taking no care whether their ſtomachs be full or empty, or the meat be raw or digeſted, whether it be day or night, regarding no opportunity of time, obey nothing but their own luſts, and boaſt themſelves to be ſo luſty, that they will never be weary with copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but theſe inſatiable Lechers ſeem to me to be ignorant for what end the genital parts were given to man, ſince they uſe them not to get children, and propagate their kind, but for obſcene pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, for barren pleaſure; but at laſt they pay for their unruly luſt, when their parts and joynts are tormented with Gowts and Aches.</p>

Then the ſpirit that comes by the Arteries from the Heart, by force whereof the yard is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53844:22"/>erected, and growes ſtiff, and by the force whereof the ſeed is eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To this may be added the appetite and deſire of copulation, which is excited either by Imagination, or by ſight and feeling of handſome women. Whoſoever wants theſe helps, or hath them feeble, muſt ſo ſoon as may be uſe means to reſtore nature, and to correct this errour, and repair the forces, as when there is a luxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or disjoynting in any part.<note place="margin">A Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from Husbandry.</note> For as we ſee barren fields grow fruitfull by tilling and mans induſtry, and unfruitfull Trees and Plants by pruning and dunging grow very plentifull in fruit; So in dreſſing this ground the Phyſical art is much to be obſerved, that with great skill cures the defects of Nature, and reſtores this barren field to bring forth fruit again, as it were, by dunging it, when the heart of it was almoſt quite worn out. So it reſtores the faint heat, and the weak ſpirits, coldneſſe and drineſſe of the genital parts, and reduceth the weakneſſe of the nerves to their temperament: and it doth farther do all things that may ſerve to remove all impediments of procreation of Children. But ſince that dyet may change the Elementary qualities, and may alter the unhappy ſtate of the body to a better, it is neceſſary that ſuch people ſhould eat onely ſuch meat as will make them fruitful for propagation;<note place="margin">What meats cauſe ſeed, and ſtir up venery.</note> Amongſt ſuch things as ſtir up venery, and breed ſeed for generation, are all meats of good juice, that nouriſh well, and make the body lively and full of ſap, of which faculty are all hot and moiſt meats.

For as we ſee Guns firſt charged with powder, and then with bullets, and laſtly, ſome fine powder is put in the pan, and fire is given with a Linſtock, and the bullet is forced out with a violent noiſe; ſo in this work two things muſt needs concur, that our labour be not loſt, namely, that there be plenty of ſeed, and a force of a flatulent ſpirit, whereby the ſeed may be driven forth into the Matrix. But if theſe Engines be broken, or nothing worth, or the Gun-powder be adulterated and naught, they can have no force to break down walls and Trenches, and Ramparts, not do they roar horribly, but make a ſmall hiſſing, and empty noiſe, as bladders of boys at play do, when they are blown
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53844:22"/>up. Hence ſome of our laſcivious women will ſay, that ſuch men that trouble their wives to no purpoſe, do thunder,<note place="margin">The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.</note> but there follows no rain, they do not water the inward ground of the matrix. They have their veins puffed up with wind, but there wants ſeed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if husbands will win their wives love by eſpeciall ſervice, they muſt be well prepared to enter this conflict; for if they fall ſhort,<note place="margin">How Wives are pleaſed.</note> they ſhall find their wives ſo crabbed and touchy, that there will be no quiet. But when they are well provided, they muſt take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing their buſineſſe well. And that is when the monethly terms are over; For that ſink hinders their ſeed from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating and fermenting, and makes the womb unfit to conceive. When therefore the Terms are over, and the womb is well cleanſed, they muſt uſe no unlawful copulation, or violent concuſſions in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting children, and when the work is over, the woman muſt gently and ſoftly lye down on her right ſide, with her head lying low, &amp; her body ſinking down, and ſo fall to ſleep.<note place="margin">When a Boy is begot.</note> For by this means the ſeed will fall to the right ſide, and a boy will be made. Yet the time of the year, the Climate, the age of both parties, the heating dyet, are of great concernment here. For the Summer, if it be not too hot, is fitteſt for the conceiving of boys, becauſe the ſeed and menſtruall blood receive more heat from the Ayr about them. Alſo a hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, ripe years, and luſty, and hairy bodies are fitteſt to beget boys. Alſo there are many things that by a ſpeciall and hidden quality are fit for this purpoſe. So <hi>Mercury,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What herb-<hi>Mercury</hi> can do.</note> that is divided into male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, is held to be moſt effectuall in producing Children of the ſame kind with it, ſo that the decoction of juice of the Male drank four dayes from the firſt day of purgation, will give force to the womb to procreate a male Child: but the juice of the Female drank for ſo many dayes, and in the ſame manner, will cauſe a female to be born, eſpecially if the man lye with his wife when the Terms are newly over. I think it is, becauſe the one purgeth the right ſide of the matrix, and the other the left, and foſters it with heat. So it comes to paſſe, that the cold humour being taken away, the woman is made fit for conception.<note place="margin">A Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from the Earth.</note> For as in boggy and watry grounds the ſeeds of Plants are drown'd, nor do they eaſily grow forth, ſo by the ſuperfluity of a cold humour the ſeeds of men are choked, that the force and faculty of the womb can make no ſex nor form of them. Seſeli of Marſilea is of the like effect, Sage, Nutmegs, Cinamon, Caſſia Lignea, Zedoary, Lignum Aloes, Maſterwort, Calamint, Clary, Dittany, Elecampane, Orris root, juice of Motherwort, and innumerable things of this kind, that diſcuſs winds,<note place="margin">What things purge the watrineſſe of the womb.</note> and wipe away ſuperfluous moyſture, and prepare the womb as till'd grounds for to ſow the ſeeds on. So other things by other forces cauſe that the matrix be not ſo ſlippery, that the ſeed may ſtick the faſter. Of this kind are Amber, ſhavings of Ivory, Storax Calamita, Harts-horn, Sumach, Blatta Byzantina, Myrtil ſeed, Witwalls, Cypreſſe Nuts, Frankincenſe, with the bark, Maſtick, Spoonwort, Avens, Cinque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foil, red Roſes: whereof ſome applyed outwardly, others taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, ſtrengthen the womb, and conſume ſuperfluous moyſture,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53844:23"/>bind cloſe the gaping of the matrix, and make it hold the Seed; and becauſe the women on this ſide the <hi>Alps</hi> for the moſt part are ſubject to fits of the mother, and ſuch diſeaſes of the womb, they had need uſe theſe things before others. But if the parts be overdryed and burnt, they muſt uſe moderately moyſtning means, both Meats and Phyſick.<note place="margin">A dry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix what is good for it.</note> But they that would be commended for their wedlock actions, and not be without Children, they muſt obſerve this rule, to lie with their Wives at diſtance of time, not too often, nor yet too ſeldome, for both theſe hurt fruitfulneſſe alike. For to eject immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately weakens a man, and ſpends his ſpirits; and to forbear lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than it is convenient, makes the ſeed ineffectuall and not manly enough.

For the left parts, as being cold and benummed, and void of blood, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contribute any thing ſo ſoon as the terms are purged; but blood is drawn later, and more ſparingly from the veins of the left ſide, which are called the Emulgent veins,<note place="margin">Emulgent veins.</note> that creep about the Milt, and the left Kidney; ſo that at length after the firſt day untill the eighth day ſome blood comes forth of them, whereby the Child is to be nouriſhed. So that when thoſe parts perform their office, and the right ſide parts do ceaſe, by reaſon of the ſcituation, and cold nutriment, a female is begot. After the eighth day the parts on the right ſide do their office again, and blood comes from them to nouriſh a male. After this circuit of dayes, becauſe the menſtrual blood flowes, without diſtinction from all parts, and the matrix is made too moyſt with cold humours flowing unto it, and the ſeed joyns to neither ſide, but flotes in the midſt of the womb betwixt both:<note place="margin">What begus Herma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodites.</note> The ſeed of both Sexes confounded make an Hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, which conception takes its form and forces ſometimes from the left, ſometimes from the right ſide, and uſeth the help of them both. Hence Hermaphrodites are begot; which name is ſo call'd from <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi>

For when the helps be wanting that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conception, and the matrix wants the humour ſhould feed the Child, how can a woman conceive?<note place="margin">A Similitude from flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing ſhrubs.</note> But our Matrons eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Midwives, reaſon thus from Trees: as no Plant wants fruit that bears flowers; and no Tree is barren that yields bloſſoms, but every Tree is unfruitfull that wants flowers: ſo young Maids that have no courſes conceive not, nor do their wombs ſwell, though they receive the ſeed.<note place="margin">When the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſtay, then ſtayes fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> But women in years bear Children no longer after their terms are ſtopt. For ſince the flux of this excrement affords matter to generation of Mankind, the ſeed of man, like runnet and leaven, heaping this up within it ſelf, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that a woman cannot conceive either before that humour begins to run, nor after that it leaves off to run any longer, becauſe the nutriment for the Child is wanting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What uſe of the terms.</note>But here ariſeth another queſtion: whether the menſtrual bloud be a profitable Excrement, and fit to ſeed the child? or onely a filthy matter, which at ſet times is voided as a ſink. I know that <hi>Pliny</hi> and many more think ſo, who ſuppoſe that the menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bloud is venemous and monſtrous, and they do wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rayſe this opinion.

                  <p>For <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the Authour of Phyſick, and <hi>Galen</hi> a great lover of it, do rightly profeſſe in many places that the menſtrual bloud feeds the child, and that the child grows by receiving that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the veins.<note place="margin">De tuenda va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letudine.</note> So <hi>Galen:</hi> Blood, ſaith he, and genital ſeed are the beginnings of our Generation, which ariſe from the very principles, as from a root. <hi>The blood is as fit matter that obeys the Artificer, the ſeed is as the Workmaſter.</hi> Again, <hi>in comment.

If a Woman with child have her courſes, the child cannot be well, For the blood is taken thus from her,</hi> that is directed to the womb from all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to feed the child. If therefore the courſes running away, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the child, and defraud him of his nouriſhment, it muſt needs be that they do good when they are ſtopt, and ſerve to feed the child all the while it is in the womb.<note place="margin">The Breaſts fill with milk when the terms ſtop.</note> If they do no good, and the child hath no nutriment from them, I pray what is the cauſe that the courſes are ſtopt in women with child, and ſuch as give ſuck, and that without any hurt to them? There can be no other cauſe given but that they are conſumed to make plenty of milk, or to feed the child. But to explain this queſtion the more fully. I ſhall ſet down this dilemma; If the courſes confer nothing to feed the child,<note place="margin">The Authours dilemma of the monethly terms.</note> then women may conceive though they want their courſes, for nature can draw blood from the veins to feed the child: But if they do help to feed and increaſe the child, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive unleſſe they do run: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> excellently unties this knot;<note place="margin">Hiſt. Animal.</note> Women (ſaith he) conceive naturally after their terms are over, and they that want their terms are commonly barren: Yet it may be that ſome may conceive that have them not, namely as many as have ſo much humour collected in their wombs, as uſeth to remain with thoſe that are purged. For ſome have the humour remaining in the womb, but not ſo much as to break forth and run out, yet enough to feed the child. For many when the courſes run do conceive, but they cannot conceive afterwards, for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix preſently after purgation cloſeth, and the places are no longer open.<note place="margin">De vul. ſe.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> clearly explains the ſame in theſe words. The veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Matrix that penetrate into the inmoſt part, from whence flow the terms, when the woman is about to conceive open their orifices; But the time of conception is when the terms begin, or at leaſt end. For though the reſt of the time of purging theſe orifices are open, yet the woman can by no means conceive, becauſe the ſeed cannot ſtay in the womb, but is waſht away by the blood that runs in ſo plentifully. But when the terms end or begin, the orifices are open, and the menſtrual blood runs not by ſtreams, but gently forth, by little and little, as by a dewy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſweating in, whereby the Matrix is moiſtned; whence it is that the ſeed ſticks to the roughneſſe of the womb, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough follows by the dropping of bloud that flowes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53844:24"/>For before the Terms flow, conception cannot be made, becauſe the nouriſhment is wanting, nor doth the ſeed ſtick faſt; for at that time the veſſels being ſhut, the matrix is ſmooth, and the ſeed by reaſon of ſmoothneſſe like glaſſe poliſhed, runs away, and cannot ſtick and unite; for roughed things are fitter than ſmooth things to ſodder together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Why Whores conceive not.</note>Hence it is, that whores by frequent lying with men do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. To which appertains that ſentence of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> Thoſe that have moyſt wombs do not conceive,<note place="margin">

Likewiſe they that have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry matrixes are unfit to bear children; for it is neceſſary, that the parts ſhould be wet with the dropping of the <hi>menſtrua.</hi> I do not now diſcuſſe the matter, what ſtrong arguments they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon who think the terms not needfull to nouriſh the Child. Let them hold their opinion; but I can never believe that this humour is unprofitable, and doth not ſerve toward the Childs generation. For ſince all women that are in perfect health have their courſes at ſet times, what can we think but that this humour runs forth for ſome end, and is not venomous, unleſſe it ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Natures time in the body, or it be reſtrain'd by ſome diſeaſe or accident. So in plethorick bodies, that is,<note place="margin">Continual Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</note> ſuch as are full of humours, pure blood if it be not ventilated corrupts, and cauſes a putrid feaver, and other next to contagious diſeaſes, as the ſmall Pox and Meaſels;<note place="margin">A Simile from houſes ſhut up.</note> ſo we ſee houſes long ſhut and not cleanſed by the wind, to grow muſty, and ſmell filthily. Since therefore the terms are an excretion of ſuperfluous blood, which the weakneſſe of that ſex can neither concoct by heat, nor diſcuſſe by exerciſe, it muſt needs break forth by the Moons urging of it at a ſet time; and by the running out thereof the body is cleanſed; and if it chance to be ſtopped longer; it growes venomous by corrupting. But it is not ſo in Nurſes, or women with child:<note place="margin">What menſtrua are venemous.</note> for it is a ſtrong argument, becauſe that humour is uſefull in its time, and fit to nouriſh the Child; but that is not ſo, that by long ſtay corrupts in the body: But becauſe after conception it drops from the veins into the womb, and feeds the Child all the time the Woman is great with child, if the womb ſhould lye open, or the terms any way run from it, the Child cannot live, or would grow very weak.</p>

                     <note place="margin">How the mind raiſeth it ſelf toward God.</note>THe Soul of Man is by no means more invited to love God, nor can know it ſelf better, than by ſearching into it ſelf, and when it doth narrowly conſider the excellency of its own mind. For ſo it comes to paſſe, that a man lifts up his mind towards God, and comes to know him, and deſpiſing all filthy vice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks himſelf,<note place="margin">Man is Gods Image.</note> that he hath fellowſhip with the Divine Nature. And truly it is not idly to be paſſed over, that man hath the breath of life from God, and is made after Gods Image. The dignity and prerogative of which gift let no man think to conſiſt in the outward form of the body, but in the internal part, that is, the rational Soul of man; which ſince it is an heavenly ſpirit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal ſubſtance, taken from the pattern of the divine mind, this is it that makes a man excell other creatures, becauſe he is like God, and partakes of the divine eſſence. But becauſe God made the body of Earth, it is mortal, and endures but for a time; but the Soul that God breathed from himſelf is immortal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible. For ſince Gods eſſence is eternal, and the Soul of Man proceeded from it, it muſt needs be eternal and immortal, as its original is. And though the forces of the ſoul are much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and do not ſo exactly repreſent the Makers Image, yet it is not quite loſt, for the wound the Devil gave it is cured by our Saviours mercy, and his munificence and vertue hath reſtored that which was fouly defaced by the fall of our firſt Parents.<note place="margin">God the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of decayed Nature.</note> If any man would make tryall of this Divine gift, and ſee the Excellency thereof, let him deſcend into himſelf, and ſearch diligently into his own mind; he ſhall be ſure to find there admirable gifts, and excellent ornaments in abundance,<note place="margin">The Gifts and Ornaments of the Soul.</note> with which every ones mind is richly endowed; as Reaſon, Underſtanding, Judgment, true choice, agility of Wit, Memory, and many more, that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely prove the Soul to be more admirable, than that we ſhould think it to be corporeall or ſubject to corruption.<note place="margin">The force and excellency of the Mind.</note> This onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveneth and rules the body, and inſtructs it with various actions, exerciſing it with many offices.

                     </q> Hence theſe ſuperſtitious Philoſophers forbad the eating of fleſh, thinking it abominable to taſte the fleſh of any creature, leſt one might cnance to eat his Grandfather in a calf,<note place="margin">

Chriſtians muſt reject ſuch opinions; for Orthodox Divines conclude for certain, that the Soul is given to every Infant, and infuſed into it, when the Child is perfect in all parts of the body,<note place="margin">When the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Soul comes into Man.</note> which happens about the 45. day common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after conception, eſpecially for males that are like to come forth to ſee the light in 9. moneths. But females that are of a weaker conſtitution, receive not their Souls till about the 50 day. And though this day cannot be certainly ſet down, yet <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath exactly reckoned it, at what time the Child hath its perfect form, when it begins to move, and when it ſhall be born. For in his Book of the <hi>Nature of the Infant, If a Male</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be perfect on the</hi> 30 <hi>day, he will move on the</hi> 60 <hi>day, and he will be born in the ſeventh moneth: But if he be perfectly formed on the</hi> 35 <hi>day, he will move on the</hi> 70 <hi>day, and begin to come forth in the eighth moneth: But if he be perfectly formed on the</hi> 45 <hi>day, he moves the</hi> 90 <hi>day, and is. born in nine moneths.</hi> Out of which paſſing of dayes and moneths it appears clearly, that the day of forming being doubled, makes up the day of moving; and the day of moving, 3. times reckoned, makes up the time of being born. For example, where 35 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects' the form, if you double that, it will make 70, the day of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that, 3. times taken, makes 206 dayes or 7. moneths, giving every moneth 30 dayes, ſo you muſt conſider of the reſt. But a Female is made perfect in longer time than a Male,<note place="margin">A female is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect later than a male.</note> and the mother goes longer of a girle, ſo that there is ſome difference in the accompt. For a female formed on the 30 day, moves not till the 70 day, and is born in the ſeventh moneth. When ſhe is formed on the 40 day, ſhe moves on the 80 day, and is born in the eighth moneth. But if ſhe be perfectly formed on the 45 day, ſhe moves on the 90 day, and is born in the ninth moneth. But ſhe that is formed on the 50 day, moves on the 100 day, and is born in the tenth moneth. I have ſpoke the more largely hereof
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53844:26"/>whereby every man may underſtand that the reaſonable ſoul is then infuſed, when the child hath its perfect form, and is exactly diſtinguiſhed in his lineaments. For the ſoul is not preſent in the firſt Moneth the child begins to be formed, but the faculty of the Matrix, and the force of the ſeed perform that work very cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by degrees diſtinguiſh the parts, and make the form per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For the firſt ſix dayes the ſeed lies like an Egg,<note place="margin">The rudiments of Mans form.</note> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents Creme or Milk, and thin fibres woven like cobwebs are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the nine dayes following, the Navel veins and the Cups, do adminiſter blood and ſpirit, from whence are framed the orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall parts, and ſuch as ſerve for nutrition, as the Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lungs, brain, which from the firſt moment of Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are perfected the eighteenth day: then till the fourty fourth day the other parts are perfected, and the child begins to live and feel, though it move not being weak, or it moves ſo weakly that the Mother cannot perceive it. At this time the rational ſoul is thought to enter, and to add force to the natural faculties, and to perfect the whole work which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> proves by the teſtimony of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

Which force of the ſoul, as <hi>Galen</hi> knew very well, ſo he ingenuouſly confeſſeth that he is ignorant what is the ſubſtance of Mans ſoul, and whence it comes. But had he been learned in better Philoſophy,<note place="margin">What the Soul is.</note> he would not have doubted to ſay that the ſoul is a ſpark of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mind, and a blaſt of God that diſtinguiſheth man from beaſts, and makes us immortal. But that every man hath a particular ſoul, as it is proved by many things, ſo eſpecially the vaſt difference between the manners, wits, judgments, opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and affections of men doth confirm this. So <hi>Horace</hi> writes,</p>
                  <q>

                  </q>
                  <p>Which I think proceeds onely from the divers conditions of their ſouls. For God, ſaith <hi>David,</hi>

                        <hi>Pſalm</hi> 33.15.</note> hath in particular faſhioned the hearts and minds of all men, and hath given to every one its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being, and a ſoul of its own nature. Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> rejoyceth that God had given him a happy ſoul, and a pure body agreeing with the manners of his ſoul. Many of the Ancients queſtion in what part of the body the ſoul hath its ſeat. Philoſophers ſay, in the middle of the heart, which the Wiſeman ſeems to point at, <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, becauſe life proceeds therefrom.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.</note> But Phyſitians that have ſearched the works of nature more narrowly;<note place="margin">The houſe of the ſoul.</note> place the ſoul in the Brain, from whence all the ſenſes and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul and the actions proceed. Yet the force of it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through all the parts of the body; it foſters and enlivens all the parts with heat, and gives them force. But it doth give pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar force to the heart, the fountain of life,<note place="margin">Apoplectick-veins.</note> by the Arteries caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides, or ſleepy Arteries that pats upon the throat, which being cut, men grow barren, or if they be ſtopt, they become apople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick; for there muſt neceſſarily be ſome ways and paſſages of the veins, and Arteries, through which the humours and ſpirits animal and vital may paſſe to and fro, &amp; receive native heat from the ſoul. For as a Parlour, though it be large, grows hot with a good fire, and a Dining room is warmed all over with a hot Stove;<note place="margin">A ſimile from a hot fire.</note> ſo the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives effectually the forces of the ſoul ſpread all over, and by the help thereof performs its operations. For though the ſoul is ſaid to reſide in one place, yet the force of it paſſeth far and near, and is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53844:27"/>ſeen in every part of the body, and exerciſeth every member. So the eyes, ears, noſtrils, tongue, the joynts of hands and feet are the Souls Inſtruments that ſhe uſeth.<note place="margin">The parts are the Soul's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</note> But if the Inſtruments and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans that ſerve the Soul be unfit or out of tune, or hindred, they perform the operations of the Soul the more imperfectly. As we ſee in fools, old men, children, and mad-men, in ſome of them the faculties of the Soul ſhew themſelves after a long time, and in others they are loſt.<note place="margin">A Simile from fire rak't up.</note> For as fire under aſhes doth not ſhine forth, and the Sun under a thick cloud affords but little light; ſo the Soul drown'd in moyſt or faulty matter is darkned, and reaſon is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded by it.</p>

As a man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Journey,<note place="margin">A Simile from a loaded Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> goes on merrily to the place he intends, but if he be overloaded, he goes on more heavily, and againſt his will, is longer on his way, before he can come to his journeys end; ſo the ſoul oppreſſed with the burden of the body, goes on very heavily, and with great difficulty attains the end it aims at. Wherefore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53844:28"/>let no man think that the body is wholly idle, but that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers and faculties of the body, and the humours in it, either hurt or help the actions of the ſoul; and that they yield mutual aid unto the other. For in vain and undeſervedly ſhould the body partake of eternal pain or joy with the body, if it were not in many things a companion and helper with it. Let the body be the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and houſe of the ſoul, let it be the receptacle, ſhop, organ, or place for it to reſide in, yet it contracts ſome ſmack from it,<note place="margin">A Simile from a Cask that is tainted.</note> as good Wine from a fuſty Cask. But if all that belongs to Man, and all his functions muſt be attributed to the ſoul, it is neceſſary that it be ſubject to paſſions,<note place="margin">The Soul ſubject to paſſions.</note> and that the body ſhould not be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at all, or but very little. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſtrives by ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove that the ſoul is not free from paſſions: Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is affected with grief, fear, ſorrow, indignation, deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is paſſible; the ſoul when it cannot have what it deſires, is grieved, &amp;c. Therefore the ſoul is ſubject to paſſions.</p>
                  <p>He ſeems to me to argue very wittily. For if the ſoul bound to the body were free of all grief or paſſions, it could feel no pain or torments in hell. But that is not ſo,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.</note> as the Hiſtory of the rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in the Goſpel confirms, who when he was in torments, deſired to have his burning tongue cooled with a drop of water, to eaſe his torments; Which is ſpoken figuratively and parabolically, that no man may think that incorporeal ſubſtances have uſe of corporeal organs. For the Scripture applies it ſelf to mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,<note place="margin">Gods parts in Scripture are figurative. How parts are aſcribed to GOD.</note> with proper words fetched from the likeneſſe of things that are, and ſo declares Gods love to thoſe that are good, and his revenge againſt the wicked. By the like figure, in ſpeech, the Bible ſets forth gods anger, zeal, ſorrow, repentance, the face, eyes, countenance, hands, arms of God, for the weakneſſe of mans mind could not any other waies apprehend the mighty force and power of God, unleſſe they were delivered to us in ſuch a common expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Since therefore it is clear from Scripture, that the fouls of men, freed from their bodies, and ordained for torments, are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, how can it be that being in the bodies, and hindred by their union with them, they ſhould not ſuffer alſo? For I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that ſouls, as coming from heaven cannot be annihilated or feel corruption; but that they are cruelly tormented, and feel the pricks and wounds of a biting conſcience: which Chriſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as <hi>Eſaias</hi> did, <hi>their worn dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. <hi>66.</hi> Mark <hi>9.</hi> A Simile From rotten Wood.</note> For as rottenneſſe and worms corrupt the hardeſt wood, and as fire conſumes all it meets with, ſo the pricks of a guilty mind wound the ſoul, and internal furies burn and torment it. When the mind burns with covetouſneſſe, is kindled with revenge, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with anger, conſumes with envy, burns in love, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with grief,<note place="margin">Rackings of the mind are worſe than of the body.</note> I think there is no man but is ready to do or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing, than to ſuffer ſuch rackings in his very ſoul, and to be ſo grievouſly tormented at the very heart. The Tortures of the ſoul are far more intollerable then the pains of the body. Which by a figure of Interrogation, that he might ſtrike deeper into the mind, <hi>Perſius</hi> thus ſet forth.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Wherefore the ſoul is afflicted an other way, by feeling and touching, than the body is when it is tormented by whipping and ſcourging, whilſt it is wounded, or racked, or burnt. For the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoul being a ſpirit incorporeal, hath inward tortures, griefs, fears, jealouſies, envies, hatred, indignation, and rackings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Which affections, are more properly perturbations, if they ſtay longer in the mind, and cannot be diſcuſſed by reaſon, nor by divine help, they not onely afflict the mind moſt cruelly, but the body alſo. Wherefore they are both ſubject to one the others laws, and bound mutually together. Yet the ſoul hath this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, for her honour and dignity,<note place="margin">The ſoul doth many things without the body.</note> that ſhe doth many things of her ſelf, but the body can do nothing without her direction.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the ſoul doth two waies perfect her faculties; ſome of them by organs, ſome without them, and with no help of the body. So, what actions are done by reaſon and underſtanding, and judgment of the mind are the offices of the ſoul alone; But manual actions cannot be done without the Miniſtry of the body. For a man conceives in his mind the arts of Architecture, plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, painting, and other arts uſefull for man, but he works them with his hands,<note place="margin">When the ſoul uſeth the help of the body.</note> and uſeth other organs of the body. But when the ſoul is bent on the contemplation of things, when it remembreth things paſt, and meditates of things to come, and joyns things preſent with them, when it diſcourſeth and ſearcheth out hidden things, when it is raviſhed, and carried aloft, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, is made partaker of hidden myſteries,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> it uſeth its imbred force, received from God, and needs no bodily help, unleſſe it would act ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereby. For then the body aſſiſts the ſoul as a ſure undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded partner, and collegue, and by the help thereof the ſoul doth her actions.<note place="margin">Thoughts of the mind weaken the body.</note> But if the thoughts be overlong, and too intent upon any buſineſſe, it falls out that the body for want of the ſouls help, faints, and dies. Which we may obſerve in them that over ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy themſelves at unſeaſonable times, &amp; are too much given to their books, their body waſts by degrees, and their vital forces decay. Whoſoever therefore thinks that the mind is moved with no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but that the mind and ſoul are entire, and is onely affected by reaſon of the object, and the organ, do not ſeem to me to ſpeak what agrees with the truth.<note place="margin">Chriſts fear ſhews he was a Man.</note> For what is the meaning of that Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and perplexity our Saviour endured when he conceived in his mind the horridneſſe of the puniſhment he ſhould undergo, and the great ingratitude and forgetfulneſſe of Man for his rich bounty: by his humane frailty, a while before his death he brake forth into this ſpeech,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>My Soul is ſorrowful unto death;</hi> and he prays againſt it unto his Father. And though the Souldiers inſolence did not as yet lay hold of him, or inſult over him; yet his whole mind and

                  <head type="sub">That the Souls of Men are not equal in all things, nor of the ſame condition and dignity, but one is better than another.</head>
                  <p>THough I mentioned ſome things a little before that concern this Argument, and that may eſtabliſh this Paradox, yet I believe it will be worth my Labour, if I enlarge this in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar treaty. Many are of that opinion, that the Souls of Men are of the ſame worth and dignity,<note place="margin">Differente in Souls.</note> and that there is no odds between the Soul of a wiſe man and good; and of a fool, or wicked man; and that the organs of the body onely hinder the actions, and the faculties of the Soul are ill performed by reaſon thereof. But I, out of no deſire of contention or contradiction, am perſwaded that it is otherwiſe. For though I know that the mind growes dull by a ſharp diſeaſe, or by a blow on the head, by ſome fall or bruiſe, and that a man may ſo forget all things; yet it followes not, that all Souls are equall, and that all men had Souls alike to judge or reaſon with. For every mans Soul, be it never ſo well adorned, and the like pains be taken to make it skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Arts and Sciences, cannot attain to the ſame Excellency, nor is alike capable of the ſame Learning and Knowledge, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans Soul is. For ſome are not at all diſpoſed to learn Arts, and it is againſt nature to bend their minds that way. For as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53844:30"/>Torches and Lights, ſome ſhine more than others do, and give more light: and as ſome burning matters,<note place="margin">A Simile from lighted Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> burn fiercer than others do; ſo the Souls of men are of a different light, and the minds of men are far diſtant in gifts one from the other. And as Angels differ in order, dignity, office, Miniſtry, one from the other,<note place="margin">Angels are of different excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies.</note> as Seraphims, Cherubins, Thrones, Powers, Vertues, Archangels, and the whole Hierarchy of Angels demonſtrate; ſo I ſee that there may be a difference ſet between mens Souls: They all agree in this, that they dwell in a mortal body, that hath the ſhape of a man, though ſome look more like ſavage beaſts, and are next unto them: That all men are given to procreation; that the ſame Lawes of Nature ſhould govern them all; That the ſame force of reaſon urgeth them; That the eſſence of their Soul, and form of their ſubſtance is created by God; That they are all immortall, and all endowed with one ſpirit. But becauſe the force of the Divine Nature doth not ſo ſtrongly ſhew it ſelf in all, nor are all equally capable of his gift,<note place="margin">Diſparity of Souls.</note> and ſome make themſelves unworthy of ſo great a Benefit, it comes to paſſe, that the Souls produce their actions by another force and effect; nor are they in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, ſtate, dignity, and order, equal; nor ſhall they be equal in glory in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as one Star is brighter than another, and their bodies are very divers, ſo great is the difference in the ſouls of men, and in the reſurrection one Soul ſhall be far more glorious than another.<note place="margin">

But this is not ſo in Man; For there are infinite reaſons and wayes of mens Actions; nor are all men enclined to one operation, or to one thing, as Bruits are that are ruled by nature onely, and their actions tend all one way.

So the Soul and Body have their failings and Eclipſes; and one part oft-times either profits or hurts the other. Since therefore there is ſo great union and faithfull ſociety between theſe two, and ſo long as they keep ſentinel in this life, they mutually aſſiſt one the other, it is fit that the body ſhould riſe again to partake of the ſame glory, and be admitted into the ſame liberty.<note place="margin">Conſent of Soul and Body.</note> If any man like <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> are ſo dull, they cannot underſtand how this ſhall come to paſſe, let him not deny Gods power, or diſtruſt him, but let him raiſe his heart and eyes unto him who is the Maker of all things, and in the works of Creation he ſhall find enough to let him underſtand that God wants no power, not onely to reſtore Man again, but to do whatſoever he hath determined.

Since therefore God the Creatour is ſo omnipotent in power, who can ſay he wants power to reſtore the dead, who made all things of nothing? And if the Creatour made mans body of nothing without any labour: how much more eaſie is it for him to raiſe the dead to life again; not of nothing, but from the ſame matter, turn'd to aſhes, or reſolved into the Ayr, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the winds.<note place="margin">A Simile from Founders of Mettals.</note> But as an Artificer when a veſſel is broken or ſpoyl'd, makes it up again by caſting it of the ſame mettal,

There are indeed, amongſt ſo many millions of men, many that are deformed in body, and are of an horrid aſpect, with hogs ſnowt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely Jaws; yet all theſe though they are far from the natural ſhape of Man are referred to the number of men: For they ſpeak, diſcourſe, judge, remember, and perform other offices of the Soul, and perfect their actions after the manner of men, though they ſomewhat degenerate from mans dignity, and his imbred force of Nature.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Whence mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous ſhapes proceed.</note>Now a Monſtrous habit of body is contracted divers wayes. For fear, frights, influence of the Stars, too much or too little ſeed, Imagination of women with child, and divers phantaſms which the mind conceives, deform the body, and cauſe Children to be of a ſhape not proper to the Sex. Sometimes the whole courſe of Nature is changed, either when the ſeeds are vitiated, or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments be unfit, ſo that the natural faculties to propagate and form the Child cannot perform their offices exactly.<note place="margin">A Simile from the Induſtry of an Artificer.</note> For as the moſt Induſtrious Artiſt cannot bring to perfection a work happily begun, where the matter is naught, or the Inſtruments are dull; ſo Nature wanting the forces of her faculties, or not having a fit matter, doth all things ill, and fails of her end. Some there are that by their operation, do make ſome parts of the body otherwiſe than Nature made them. So in <hi>Aſia,</hi> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teſtifies,<note place="margin">Of Ayr and places.</note> there were great heads, that the Nurſes made their heads to be long figured: for that they thought was a ſign of a noble and generous ſpirit, as a Hawk noſe was amongſt the <hi>Perſians;</hi> whereby at length it came to paſſe, that though the Midwives ceaſed to preſſe the childrens heads, yet nature whileſt ſhe was forming the child, agreed with the ancient cuſtome, and what they did by great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Nature did of her own accord. Alſo nutriments, and the qualities of the outward Ayr make ſome parts deformed. So they

Many Countries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Pigmies, and little men, very ſhort. Other Countreys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce people with great throats, and ſcrophulous tumours, with flat noſes, crooked legs. Yet though many things be wanting in theſe people, and the parts be either ill framed or wreſted amiſſe; yet becauſe they are born of women, and ſome force of reaſon ſhines in them, and they are led by the ſame Laws of Nature, Orthodox Divines ſay, There is a rational ſoul in them, and that they ſhall riſe again.<note place="margin">The Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore bodies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to their right ſhape.</note> And by riſing again they ſhall lay aſide all deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their bodies that were ill favoured to behold, and be well formed like as men are, and all lame crooked imperfect limbs ſhall be made perfect.

But Abortion oft-times ſhews the parts of the Infant perfectly made up, which when it is 42 dayes old, is endowed with a rational Soul, and is alive. Whence, if it chance to be caſt forth by ſome ſudden accident, it ſhall one day riſe again.

Wherefore it is much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what age a man is of, of what education, under what cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate he was born and bred, what temper and conſtitution his body is of, laſtly whoſe company he keeps, what diet he uſeth, and what is the abundance and quality of the humours,<note place="margin">The manners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the humours.</note> at that time.

                  <p>By which variety of wits, manners and affections, it ſeems to me that the paſſions and propenſions of every mans mind, are to be referred to many cauſes. For though the objects, and the heart it ſelf, and the parts ordain'd for nutriment, and to ingender ſpirits, are the organs, and receptacles of the affections, yet the humours within the body,<note place="margin">What things ſharpen the paſſions.</note> immoderate heat, influence of the Stars, facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Alements, qualities of the Ayre about them, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate uſe of Wine kindle the fire, and are the Seminaries of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the mind, and ſtirring the paſſions. Hence conſider what hurt may come to reaſon, and to the mind of man, where the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, ſpirits, and humours, have contracted any vice. For ſo a man falls from his dignity, and becomes a beaſt. Which the kingly Prophet complains of; Man being in honour, is like the beaſts that periſh.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſalm</hi> 48.</note> For his reaſon is extinguiſhed, and the light of his mind is overwhelmed with vitious affections. For as lights and Candles give leſſe light,<note place="margin">A Simile from a Torch.</note> when they are ſet in a Candleſtick that is fowl and dirty: ſo the mind of man darkned by the groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the body, ſhines leſſe, and is more ſlow in putting forth her ſelf; It is indeed natural for ſanguin people to be merry, for melancholique to be ſad, for flegmatique to be dull and drowſy, for cholerique men to be angry:<note place="margin">When paſſions are mildeſt.</note> But all theſe paſſions are mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and leſſe faulty where the humours are moderate, and are vitiated with no ſtrange quality. But if their quality or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance be augmented, or overpaſſe moderation, a man is affected many wayes, and turn'd off from the uſe of reaſon. And though the Elementary qualities,<note place="margin">The Stars and humours are violent, yet cauſe no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</note> and humours, and ſpirits impoſe no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon any man to do this or that, nor yet do the aſpects of the Stars: Yet they have ſo much force in moving the paſſions, that men, though reaſon ſtrive againſt it, are run upon rocks by the tempeſts of their paſſions. For as is the diſtemper of the Ayre and of the Sea, and as the violence of Wine drank overmuch is great; ſuch is the violence of a melancholique or cholerick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, if it be overmuch augmented.<note place="margin">All men are ſubject to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</note> And what man, if he look nearly into himſelf and ſearch his own nature, will not preſently perceive turbulent motions, and paſſions? ſo that ſometimes he will be more angry, more froward, more envious, more laſcivious, or more inclin'd to one or another paſſion according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the humours. And if the mind of man endure ſuch changes, where the humours do but a little degenerate from their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53844:40"/>natural tempers, that in a moment the mind is hurrried with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers affections, what ſhall we think will become of it, when they are proceeded to the height of miſchief, and have ſeiſed forcibly on the principal parts?

Wherefore they that deſire to live in good health, and to be free from ſuch miſchiefs, muſt live temperately, leaſt their minds be darkned with the thick ſmoak of the humours, and ſo diſquiered with ſtrange and abſurd Imaginations,<note place="margin">That all Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers muſt ſhake off melancholy.</note> and removed from their proper places.

But if they be once ſtain'd and troubleſome, many paſſions of the mind ariſe, and turbulent affections. Since therefore both Soul and body are affected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; firſt care muſt be taken, to ſweeten and abate the troubles of the mind with pleaſing words.

Yet ſometimes, as for the diſeaſes of the body, inciſions, cauſticks, and burnings are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: ſo ſometimes we muſt be more violent, and bridle ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed actions by wholeſome correcting ſpeeches, unto which at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when the noxious humour boyls over, they are wont to be tempted. And there muſt be no leſſe care taken for the body. But let him remember that undertakes the cure, that he do not raiſe that humour with violent medicaments, but by degrees and eaſily, and with as great dexterity as poſſibly he can, for it is not good to exhauſt that ſink all at once. For that humour ſtirred, breaths forth a kind of ach in the back, and ill ſavour that diſturbs the brain incredibly, that the mind conceives ſtrange things. But firſt the ſpirits muſt be raiſed with ſweet ſmels and noſe-gays, and the body muſt be fed with juice of the beſt meats, and they muſt ſleep on ſoft beds.

                  <p>MAny Phyſitians complain, that the deſcriptions of Plants are falſe, and their vertues are uneffectual; and that there were many Plants obvious and common in former times, that if we compare them with theſe of our times, ours will anſwer to them neither in name nor deſcriptions; and therefore they ſay they are other plants, though we call them ſtill by the ſame names. So our Hyſſop, Beans, Cinquefoil, Valerian, Tyf, wheat, Provender, Rie, Amelcorn, they think not to be the ſame, becauſe they do not exactly agree with the deſcriptions of the Antients. For as I would defend no mens errours that are deceived in the choice and knowledge of Plants: ſo I think that ſome men do not ſufficiently meaſure all things by the ſqure of reaſon. For though in ſo great a change and variety of herbs all of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ranged into a certain Claſsis, nor can we give them a fit name that may anſwer the deſcription of the Antients; yet we muſt not think that they are other plants than what were deſcribed by the Antients, or of other operations than ſuch as they ſet down. For Nature it ſelf gave a cauſe for this Variety, if there be any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which daily changeth the form,<note place="margin">Natures ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in Plants.</note> and is luxuriant in producing new manner of plants, that they ſeem to differ from thoſe they come from.

For as children that the Nurſes keep the breaſts from, or ſeldome feed them, do grow lean and ſtarved, and look pale, or not very lively; ſo plants that grow in lean hungry barren ground, are ill-favoured and not ſo pleaſant to behold. Whence you may ſee plants that grow on walls and ſtony grounds, ſcarſe a hands breadth in heighth; and if the ſame be ſet in a fruitful ground they will grow a cubit &amp; a half high, and will ſend forth their branches long and broad. So Bugloſs and great Comfrey, are oft-times ſeen with white flowers; ſo Clove-gelliflowers either by art, or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the ground, will yield a white, red, various colour'd flower, upon the ſame ſtem and ſtalk. So the purple violet colour decayes ſometimes and turns blew.<note place="margin">The flowers of herbs are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into divers colours.</note> By the ſame reaſon ſome leafs of Plants are not ſo jagged and nicked: and prickly plants grow more gentle and ſmooth, according as the ground is higher or lower they grow on.

For they alwayes are like the thing they are called by in ſome part; and they have the effects peculiar to the earth they grow in, and fit for the nature of the

For many plants are brought forth of the fortunate Iſlands, which Men call the Canaries, which being uſed in our climate, do not hold the ſame forces in all things, nor do they grow of the ſame form and magnitude; yet they do not wholly loſe their natural force and former Being, though they depart ſomething from their firſt original nature, and vigour.

But as I deny not this, ſo I believe, eſpecially concerning plants, that many of them fail and degenerate, chiefly by reaſon of the negligence or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gardners. So Wheat, as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Of the cauſes plants.</note> is changed into Darnel, Baſil into wild Marjorum, water-Mints into Mints in ſmell, but in form into Calamint, and many kinds of herbs, if care be not taken, do commonly, not onely change their form, but loſe alſo their imbred vertues. Which as in many herbs.<note place="margin">All things bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by dreſſing.</note> So I have obſerved in the Violet called <hi>Altilis,</hi> a moſt beautifull flower, which unleſſe it be yearly tranſplanted, it degenerates into a mean low flower that is not ſo ſweet. <hi>Virgill</hi> confirms this:</p>

                  <p>On the contrary if you dreſſe wild Plants, they will grow like thoſe of the Gardens, and lay aſide their wild natures, as <hi>Virgill</hi> alſo obſerved.</p>

                     <l>And better for our uſe, than they are wild.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Wherefore Nature brings forth continually new plants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of before,<note place="margin">A ſimile from baſe animals and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</note> and the influence of the Stars produceth many alſo, but the Art of Gardning produceth moſt of all. And as Rats, Dormice, Eels, Lampreys, Shell-fiſh, Snails, Earth-worms, do not alwaies breed from ſeed, but oft-times from ſlime of the earth, and from filth and corruption. So in ſandy grounds, ſuch as are the ſandy Mountains in <hi>Zealand,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theod. de cauſ. plant. L.c. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> which the people call the <hi>Dunen,</hi> many ſhrubs come forth naturally by the confluence of nutriment, and becauſe that place lieth open to the Sun, and is fit to breed plants, which once bred from the moyſture of the Earth, do afterwards grow up from their own ſeed, and increaſe abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. Wherefore let no man admire that plants are ſubject to be changed, and to loſe their forces and figure, when as that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it chance that they be confounded by affinity one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may proceed from the ſcituation of the place, the quality of the ambient Ayre, and the Art of the Gardner. So Pepper, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damon, large Cummin, Rhapontick, ſowed in our climate, are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53844:46"/>changed ſomething, and are not ſo hot, yet let no man ſay they are other plants.<note place="margin">Herbs change both their force and form.</note> For it is the faint heat of the Sun, and the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the climate that makes them weaker, and that they grow not ſo great, and come not to ſo much maturity. Wherefore it is clear that plants have a double change. For ſometimes they change their native forces, and keep the ſame form; ſometimes their form is changed, and their native qualities remain.</p>
                  <p>That comes to paſſe partly by the influence of the Stars, and partly by the nature of the ground, and the ambient Ayre. For ſince the earth is of divers qualities, it happens by reaſon of the Ayre, and the nutriment of the earth that plants are changed, and receive other qualities. So Haſel-Nut-Trees, Cherry Trees, Wild-Cherry Trees, if they grow near banks, that ſtinking Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters run by, or Salt waters wet, their fruit will taſt ſalt. So men as their food is, and the Ayre they live in, obtain another tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of their body, other manners and qualities. So <hi>Danes</hi> by long conſtance and comerce, change into <hi>Spaniards; Germans,</hi> into <hi>French</hi>-Men, or <hi>Italians;</hi> ſo you ſhall ſee a pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, tree ſet on ſalt ground, to degenerate by reaſon of the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſucks in.</p>

Who will not reckon theſe men amongſt thoſe, who boaſt that they know the vertues of Comfrey, Licoris, Hore-hound, ſavoury, Pennyroyal, and that onely from books, and yet cannot tell if the plant be brought to them, what that is that hath ſuch vertues, they ſo much ſpeak of? For ſince we cure diſeaſes by medicaments and effectual herbs, who is ſo mad to endure a Phyſitian that is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of theſe things? Who will not condemn ſuch a Mans igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and neglect, that is ſo dangerous for the Patient? For in my Judgment, no man is a perfect Artiſt that wants this knowledg. For as in the Marriner's Art,<note place="margin">A ſimile from the Marriner's Art.</note> there is not onely required the uſe of the oars to drive forward the veſſel, but the Seaman muſt know all the tackling, leaſt he ſhould miſtake a ſhove for an oar. So a Phyſitian muſt be principally well verſed in the knowledg of Plants. For they, when you know the nature of the diſeaſe are like an Inſtrument to go readily, and knowingly about your work. Who would not be ridiculous that ſhould go about a buſineſſe and knows not the inſtruments he muſt uſe? I cannot but admire partly their idleneſſe, partly their neglect, who deſpiſe this part of Phyſick, ſo that they have turned off this office to moſt illiterate Mountebanks: When as it is apparent that of old time not onely Phyſitians,<note place="margin">Kings of old ſtudious in plants.</note> but alſo Kings and great men were verſed in this part of Phyſick. And they deſired nothing more, and thought nothing more Kingly</p>

                  <p>And the beſt recreation they could uſe. Indeed the fame and Names of the greateſt kings had been loſt, and forgot, and no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of them had remaind, unleſſe ſome herbs growing up new every year, that bear their names, ſhould rub up their memorial, and keep them from being forgotten. A Lover of Phyſick muſt go in the ſame way, and not onely try the dubious forms of Plants, but examine the forces of them alſo, and uſe them to drive out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and preſerve the health of mankind. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> the beſt Phyſitians did ſo with great diligence, who by experience in Phyſick came to knowledg, and have laid down certain rules approved from reaſon and experience, and ſet an exact method to practiſe by. For theſe things being amplified with large deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſolid traditions, will make men Artiſts,<note place="margin">Oal. <hi>2.</hi> Aliment.</note> and ſo furniſh them with remedies, that they may eaſily cure the greateſt diſeaſes. For ſo we ſhall find great fruit of our ſtudies, and others ſhall reap conſiderable profit by us. But they that run another courſe in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53844:47"/>their ſtudies, and direct all things to their pleaſures, rather than for the uſe and good of others, deſerve very ill by their ſtudies, and do not well adviſe for the good of the people.<note place="margin">All things muſt be referred to uſe.</note>

For as all vertue, ſo all arts are to be commended for the action onely. Since therefore the Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick requires ſuch diligence, and unwearied pains, we muſt never give over, but we muſt diligently ſearch out the nature of diſeaſes, and try how to drive them out.<note place="margin">A Simile from Military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</note> And as in war we ſee new ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems and deſigns are invented, and ſtrange Engines, Guns, and Ordnance are found out; ſo, as new diſeaſes continually riſe, we muſt find out new remedies.<note place="margin">The Scurvy from a filthy ſtomach infects the gums and feet.</note> As we have done lately in the Pox, the contagious <hi>Ephemera,</hi> or Engliſh Sweat, in the black Jaundice, the ſymptoms whereof are ſore gums, and Scurvey.

Wherefore by uſe and practice, and long experience, Men gain prudence, and to do their work as they ſhould, and ſo come to their deſired end with good ſucceſſe.

                  <head type="sub">How manifold difference and variety there is in the nature of grounds.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>TO adde ſomething that is next to the former Argument, I think Phyſitians ought to conſider the nature and qualities of all grounds. For from hence ariſe divers kinds of Plants, and of divers faculties and vertues.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Epiſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Hence</hi> Hippocrates <hi>preſcribes to</hi> Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera, <hi>to gather herbs that grow on hills and high Mountains.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In what pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Plants are beſt.</note> 
                     <hi>For they are ſtronger and firmer, and more effectual than thoſe that grow near waters, by reaſon of the denſity of the Earth, and the thinneſſe of the Ayr: but to gather the flowers of them that grow near Rivers and watry places, which are weaker, and not very forcible, and of a ſweeter juice. Since therefore we know the force and temperament of Plants, by duly conſidering the nature of the ground, and ſome plants delight in one ground, ſome in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and all require ſuch Land as is proper to their natures, I will ſet down the differences of them by the way, as in a Table which</hi> Virgil <hi>exactly deſcribes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Georg.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>that ſo all plants may be fitted to their own ſoyl, and not fail in their forces by reaſon of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of nutriment. For hence it is, that they do not anſwer our expectation, but deceive us with vain hopes.</hi>

For all things that grow on grounds that are dunged,<note place="margin">Whence grain becomes ſubject to corruption.</note> yield more-unhealthful juice; ſo Wheat and other corn are ſooner ſpoil'd with Weezels, and all ſorts of pulſe growing in thoſe fields, can neither laſt long, nor be preſerved well, but they wil either be mouldy, or worm-eaten. Alſo Ale &amp; Beer in the Low-Countries boyl'd from ſuch Corn, will not laſt a whit, but growes ſowr.

For drineſſe makes all things leſſe ſubject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Some are perſwaded, and I think they are in the right, that the good and great God doth ſometimes ſend this calamity to them that are greedy and covetous of gain, who hide their corn, or keep it up too long, to the great damage of poor people, who cannot live without it.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53844:50"/>we muſt conſider, how little creatures that deſtroy the Corn may be driven away, or elſe killed.</p>

                  <p>It is obſerved, that in our times, and alſo in our Anceſtors days, the ſeed of <hi>Navews,</hi> that the Low-Countrey factors make ſo great profit of, hath a wonderful force in killing Weezels, not by any venomous quality, but by the ſweetneſſe of it.

                  <p>IT hath been ſeen ſometimes miraculouſly, that long and round Worms eſpecially, have crambled upwards, and crept forth at the mouth and the noſtrils: and they do this by an imbred
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53844:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>natural motion, if a man be long faſting. For then they bite the ſtomach,<note place="margin">Worms creeping out at the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils.</note> and ſeek for meat, and when they find none to ſatisfie them and preſerve their lives, they creep upwards, and hunt for meat as far as the very throat. For they by their natural inſtinct perceive, that the food comes in that way, and the noſtrils being open to the very throat almoſt, they creep thither, and tickle the part, or elſe they are caſt forth by ſneeſing, or are pulled forth with ones forefingers: I have oft-times obſerved this in ſound people, and when I ſhewed them the cauſe of it, I gave them content.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen this alſo happen in ſick people, but not without ſome imminent danger foreſhew'd by it: For ſo great is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction and inflammation of humours in ſuch bodies, that the Worms cannot endure the deadly force of the diſeaſe: wherefore they break forth of themſelves, not urged by any Criſis, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but from the malignity of the diſeaſe. But when the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the diſeaſe abates, and they are carried downwards with other excrements, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> holds that to be healthfull; but to come forth of their own accord,<note place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> Aph. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </note> and not forced by any faculty, as we ſee in people that are dying, is ill for the patient, for by a ſagacity of nature they find the body ready to fail, and that they ſhall want their food, and therefore they leave their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Mice forſake old houſes.</note>So it is obſerved, that Rats and Mice will forſake ruinous houſes, three moneths before they fall. For they naturally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the frame of the houſe begins to part, and that the houſe will ſhortly fall So Lice and Fleas, where they find mens bodies decay, and that the blood fails in every part, they either leave the body, or lay hold on thoſe parts that the blood and naturall heat ſtay longeſt in.<note place="margin">Experience from the ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Lice.</note> For it is approved by thoſe that ſearch and bury the dead, that they will hide themſelves in that pit of the ſtomach where the breaſt blade ends, or in that griſle that lyes upon the vocal arterie. For thoſe parts being next the heart, are hot untill the laſt breath: which when ſome related unto me that were employed about ſick people, I ſaid preſently, <hi>That it was a certain ſign of death, and that the Soul was ready to breathe forth.</hi> But ſince we formerly made mention of Worms, I thought fit to add this, That many things will kill all worms and drive them forth. But nothing is better than Worms dryed upon a tile at the fire, and the powder given to thoſe that are full of worms, will preſently drive forth all within the body: As <hi>Pliny</hi> and other ſearchers of Natural things aſſert, that a man being ſtung by a Scorpion,<note place="margin">L. <hi>10.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> the remedy is to drink in oyl or wine, the aſhes of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions.</p>
                  <p>So our Countrey-men ſay, that the biting of a mad-dog is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the burnt hairs of the ſame creature, drank in wine.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53844:51"/>the venome. So ſometimes two contrary poyſons mingled, do cure and not kill: As <hi>Auſonius</hi> wittily ſets down in an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram, concerning a woman that would have poyſoned her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with Wolfs-bane:</p>

But how unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and abſurd this is, any man can tell that is moderately verſed in the Secrets of Nature. For ſince man's body conſiſts of the mixture of the four Elements, and hath as many humours which from the faculty of the ſeed partake of four qualities, hot, moyſt, cold, dry; what can be ſaid more, than that diſeaſes ariſe from the diſtemper of theſe, by defect, or exceſſe, and from thence they take their original? It is proved, becauſe we ſee they grow mild and quiet by vomit, ſweat, opening a vein, cupping-glaſſes ſet to the part affected, by the opening of the Terms and Emrods, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the giving of Glyſters and Suppoſitaries.

The humours are under the like law, for they have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain motions, and effects and periods in mans body, that every humour keeps its turn according to the variety of the four parts of the year, and exerciſes it faculties and forces on mans body, ſo it is that the blood in the ſpring is in force, and breeds feaver and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of its own nature; ſo choler every other day in ſummer with cholerick burning cauſeth a tertian Flegm,<note place="margin">The humours keep their times.</note> corrupting in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quarter, cauſeth a quotidian intermitting, and melancholly when Autumn comes, makes a quartan. So a diary ends in one day or a little more, becauſe that conſiſts not in the putrefaction of humours, but with an aereal ſpirit enflamed. And all theſe are effected by the ſame law as the riſing and ſetting of Stars are, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is the flux and reflux of the Sea, and the pleaſant change of hearbs and plants ſpringing forth. But that is admirable that the four humours make choiſe of certain hours and times of the day,<note place="margin">The motion of the four hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> and divide the artificial day, and night amongſt them by twelve temporal hours, which to be true I have found by experience; for by obſerving them; I uſe to pronounce certainly when the feaver will come. For the blood is vigorous, as <hi>Soranus Epheſius</hi> teſtifies,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 20.</note> which like the Evangeliſts meaſure the times and ſpaces of day and night by equal hours, from nine at night, till three in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Mans mind more lively in the morning from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour of bloud.</note> in which time the blood is concocted and elaborated in the Liver, Hence it is that the mind before day break is more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and all people both ſound and ſick, are more light-hearted by reaſon of the ſweet vapour of the blood, but yellow choller hath its turn from three in the morning, till nine in the morning, in which time the natural faculty doth part the choller from the blood, and ſends it to the Gall bladder, hence it is that a man is then more prone to anger, and will be eaſily offended, but black choler, or melancholique juice doth its office from nine in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till three in the afternoon, and ſits at helm. In this time the Liver is cleanſed of this groſſe humour which is ſent to the Milt by nature; hence it is that in thoſe hours the underſtanding of man is clowded, and his mind is ſad,<note place="margin">All the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous at certain hours.</note> by the dark groſſe fumes that ariſe from thence; Flegme moves from three at night, till nine at night; for then ſupper being ended, concoction begins in the ſtomach to be perfected, and the meat to be boyled and turned to juice. Hence it is that flegme ſwimming on the ſtomach, and carried to the brain, makes a man ſleepy. Now if you exactly count the manner of all theſe, you ſhall find that the very hours that the ſeveral humours take their turns. Feavers begin to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the ſick, and as the ſpaces are ended that ſerve for the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral humours, if they be ſimple and without mixture, the diſeaſes are terminated alſo. So continent Feavers, and as many as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from blood, come upon us in the morning: tertians about nout noon, that is, at the ſixth hour, which is to us the twelfth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53844:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>hour, both of day and night. Quartans come about the ninth hour, which is to us three in the afternoon. The quotidian comes from flegme, about the firſt watch of the night. But if the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours overflow, and are mingled one with another, as they are wont to be, then they keep not their lawfull times and orders, for they are more ſharp,<note place="margin">A ſimile from the concours of the Winds.</note> and continue longer.

                  <p>It is frivolous to refer the cauſes of theſe things to ill ſpirits.

For it is theſe things that make the fits ſhorter or longer.<note place="margin">Why blood cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes continual feavers.</note> But when bloud much abounds in the body, it cauſeth but one continual fit, becauſe that putrefaction, and inflammation is in the receptacles of the veins, in which the bloud runs, as through Conduit Pipes. Wherefore nature like a wiſe and faithful conſul, in a Civill and inteſtine war, is alwaies at work, and without intermiſſion, to caſt forth the diſeaſe. But flegme,<note place="margin">A ſimile from the Wiſdome of a Conſul.</note> yellow choller, and black, becauſe they are not in ſo great quantities, and are without the ſtraightneſſe of the veins, they do not conſtantly moleſt, but with intermiſſion, and diſeaſes that ariſe from theſe humours are not ſo deadly, becauſe they have not ſo open a paſſage to the heart, and principall parts, and therefore cannot eaſily do ſo much hurt. Yet ſome of theſe Feavours laſt long, partly, becauſe the humour abounds, and, partly becauſe of the clammineſſe thereof, that it can hardly be melted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted. Wherefore Melancholiqe men are ſeldome merry,<note place="margin">Melancholique people not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drunk.</note> unleſſe they drink deep, and of ſtrong wine; for that humour is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cold and dry. Men of this conſtitution are like Iron, that muſt have a great ſtrong fire to make it hot,<note place="margin">A ſimile fit for melancholique people from bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Iron.</note> that it may be hammer'd. For they want much ſtrong Wine, and they can well endure it, and when they are well whittled, they will play the mimicks, and make ſport, and dance like Camels. For being crabbed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when they are in drink they deſire to ſeem very merry,<note place="margin">Melancholique Natures, when they are hot with wine.</note> and pleaſant. And as they are hardly overcome with drink, ſo they can as hardly be recovered of drunkenneſſe. For when they drink abundantly, and eat exceſſively; it falls out that the thick groſſe vapours ſtick faſter to the brain, ſo that the day following, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholique Imaginations grow more upon them: For from the Wine the day before not digeſted, and diſcuſſed, their whole body ſends up ſtinking vapours. For it happens to them as it is with houſes

So <hi>Raphael</hi> travelled with <hi>Tobias</hi> his Son. So the ſpirit of the Lord came upon <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and he rent the Lion like a Kid.<note place="margin">

So Satan exaſperated <hi>Sauls</hi> melancholy, and provoked him to commit many murders, and to lie in wait, and to commit many horrible things. But becauſe this affect of the mind, and errour may be referred to natural cauſes, therefore it appears that the Muſick of the Harp took away the fury of him, and his mind grew more calm. For as when ſtrong winds blow upon the Sea,<note place="margin">A ſimile from the flowing of the Sea.</note> the waves are more frequent and the Sea rages, and as melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique men grow more ſad, by loſſe of their eſtates and other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties, and cholerick people grow angry by drinking Wine, or by being jear'd, and mock'd: So evill ſpirits, or witches, drive on ſuch men headlong to wicked actions, that though the will be ready and deſires it, yet can it not moderate the actions, and force of counſels.

I have been the longer in this that the Reader may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the humours are the cauſe of diſeaſes principally. But the divells, the Stars, and the quality of the ambient Ayre, and other external cauſes are but accidental. For ſince all paſſions of the mind are quieted by reaſon, but the diſeaſes of the body are cured by fit remedies; who can refer the cauſes of diſeaſes better than to the quantity and quality of the humours? And if a man pleaſe to examine the humours of the body,<note place="margin">What manners come from bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily humours?</note> and what force they have, he ſhall find that they do not onely conſtitute the habit of the body but the manners alſo of the mind, yet ſo that manners and Religion are ſet above them in the uppermoſt place. For blood, or if you regard the qualities, heat and moyſture produce men of a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtitution; but as for the mind, they are laſcivious, merry, truly honeſt without diſſembling, and they are ſomething above Fools. But yellow chollerbrings forth men of a dry and ſwartiſh colour, but they are hot, deceitful, ingenious, of a fierce angry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, wiſe, induſtrious, cunning, inconſtant, falſe.</p>

For by theſe and many more, wherewith the Art of Phyſick abounds, being rightly adminiſtred, we ſee ſuch perſons reſtored, and to be the ſame they formerly were. When therefore the humours very frequently boil, and the ſpirits are much troubled thereby, and the exceeding ſwift motion of the mind brings forth ſome language not known before, as we ſee ſparks fall from ſtriking of a flint.<note place="margin">A ſimile from ſtriking ſire with a flint.</note> Now it is natural to mans mind to be fit and ready to learn, and it is endowed with Arts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath the uſe of them; ſo that <hi>Plato's</hi> ſaying is not unlikely, that all our knowledge is but remembrance.<note place="margin">The mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with Arts before we learn them.

For the heat of the wine ſharpens the mind, and brings forth what lyes hid in the brain. Juſt ſo do the humours affect men, when the whole force of the diſeaſe hath filled the cranies of the brain, and the mind and ſpirits both vital and animal begin to be ſtirred. We ſee ſome in burning Feavers, that are moſt vigorous commonly in Summer, who will diſcourſe very well, and ſpeak very eloquent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in that dialect, which when they are recovered, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform; which I ſaid were not troubled with the devil, and that they did not this by the devils inſtigation, but from the force of the diſeaſe, and violence of the humours, whereby the mind of man is inflamed as if a firebrand were put under it.

                  <p>WE have ſhewed elſewhere what effects the humours work in the bodies of men; but ſince they do diverſly affect us according to the diverſity of places, I thought good to ſpeak of thoſe alſo that are inherent in the brain. For thoſe diſeaſes that are in the higheſt part of the body, do not onely afflict us with pain, but alſo take away ſenſe and motion, and hurt the mind; as we may ſee in the Apoplex, Lethargy, and the Epilepſie that is weaker in children and women.<note place="margin">To whom the Epilepſie muſt be aſcribed.</note> The Falling-ſickneſſe, againſt <hi>Hippocrates</hi> mind, was aſcribed by the Antients to ſome ſpecial Saints; for when thoſe that ſtood next ſaw the diſeaſed ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly tortur'd and pull'd,<note place="margin">We muſt not aſcribe to Saints the torments of diſeaſes.</note> they thought ſome Saints that were their Enemies, or ſome ill ſpirits muſt be the cauſe thereof, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53844:55"/>ſent ſuch miſchief; wherefore they made vowes to them, and ſet up Tables for their deliverance. Hence our Age hath diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Epilepſie into many ſorts, and one they aſcribe to St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, another to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Hubert;</hi> but as no man ſhould deride the folly of theſe men; ſo I think by degrees we ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them better, to underſtand that theſe things ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to natural cauſes. For they are of divers ſorts in reſpect of the habit of the body, or largeneſſe of the paſſages, or abundance of clammy humours: hence ſome howl and bark like dogs, ſome hiſs and gnaſh their teeth; ſome cry loud and terribly:<note place="margin">Differences of Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</note> ſome are wholly mute, eſpecially their brain being ſtuffed with groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and their midriff oppreſſed, and the conduits of breathing ſtopped. Whence it comes that they cannot freely draw their breath, and theſe are moſt tormented of all men in my opinion. But the ſymptoms increaſe moſt at the full and new Moon, or when ſhe is in thoſe ſigns that reſpect the brain or heart. For then the humours abound moſt, eſpecially when after North winds the South winds begin to blow; for as theſe winds are turbulent and unwholeſome, ſo are they cold and moyſt.<note place="margin">The Moon exaſperates moyſt diſeaſes.</note> For moyſt bodies that uſe moyſt meats, and are in a moyſt climate, are more fit and ſubject to this diſeaſe: which is evident, becauſe children, and women are moſt ſubject unto this, and if it ceaſe not about the 25th year, when the natural heat is augmented,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aphor.</hi> 7. <hi>Com.</hi> 5.</note> and cauſeth a dryer temper, and if it continue beyond that age, it uſeth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company one untill Death, that is, it never ends till death put an end thereto. Since therefore the cauſe of the Falling-ſickneſſe is ſo Evident,<note place="margin">The habit of Epileptick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons terrible.</note> I would perſwade the ignorant people to think of no other cauſe of this diſeaſe, than the motion of the humours, that men may not fear ſo much, when they ſee their mouths draw awry, their cheeks ſwoln, and ſtrutting forth with a frothy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: and ſhould not be diſmaid to come near them, and lend them their help. For ſo are all thoſe that ſtand by and are fearful, amazed, when they ſee them rending themſelves, and beating their heads and bodies againſt poſts, that they think there is no hopes of them, and ſo cauſe them to be buried before their Souls are departed from them. For I have found it in our own dayes, and in former Ages alſo, that ſome have broken the Coffin, and lived again. Wherefore it is fit a Law ſhould be made, that thoſe who are to take care of the dead bodies ſhould not preſently put them into their coffins, whom they think to be dead,<note place="margin">Apoplecticks are not to be preſently bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</note> eſpecially thoſe that are ſtrangled by the Apoplex, Epilepſie, or riſing of the Mother; for oft-times their ſoul lies within them, and they live again. But when the Plague and peſtilent Feavers rule,<note place="margin">Men dead of the Plague muſt be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enterred.</note> I think it not neceſſary nor fit to obſerve this ſo ſtrictly, becauſe the contagion will preſently ſpread when they are dead, and infect thoſe that are near. For there is leſſe danger to ſtand by thoſe that have the Plague, and to attend upon them when they are alive, than to ſtand by them when they are dead,<note place="margin">A fit Simile from Candles put out.</note> for then the contagion ſpreads and infects as it goes. For it is with bodies newly dead,

Wherefore the danger is greater to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent when a man dies of the plague, than when he is yet alive, or dead and grown cold and ſtiff. But if you keep theſe bodies a little too long unburied, they become ſtinking Carkaſſes, and they do by little and little ſend forth filthy exhalations, and corrupt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy matter runs from them, which happens but ſeldome in the Apoplex and other cold diſeaſes of the brain,<note place="margin">The motion and revolution of humours in ſuch as are dead.</note> unleſſe it be very hot weather, or the bodies be very fat. And if there be no ſuch matter to hinder, they need not be buried till three dayes be over. For when ſeventy two hours are over, the humours ceaſe to move, and ſtir not, becauſe in that time the Moon hath paſſed one ſign in the Zodiack, by force whereof the humours run in the body: which ſome ſay was the reaſon, that Chriſt took occaſion to raiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> miraculouſly that was dead four dayes,<note place="margin">

For beſider that he had a mortal wound on his ſide, he lay three dayes in the Sepulchre, to take away all objections from them who would ſpeak irreverently, and not as they ought concerning his Death and Reſurrection, but calumniate all he ſaid or did. In which errour and madneſſe the Jews continue even to this day. But ſince thoſe diſeaſes are ſo formidable that bereave a man of his underſtanding, that all the ſtanders by are frighted at it, I ſhall do a conſiderable work, to add ſome preſent remedies, and thoſe not ordinary, whereby every one that is unskilful in Phyſick, may preſerve himſelf and his family from them. And becauſe all diſeaſes of the brain, eſpecially ſuch as proceed from a cold humour, are near of kin, theſe remedies may be uſed to them all indifferently, as to loſſe of memory, vertigo's, panting of the heart, trembling, Epilepſies, Lethargies, Apoplexies, and for the hag and night mare, and other diſeaſes of the night, which diſeaſe is called by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Amongſt innumerable remedies againſt theſe diſeaſes, I have found four eſpecially to be moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall,<note place="margin">Remedies for the Night-mare.</note> not ſo much approved by experience as by reaſon. The round black Piony ſeed; for the corner'd and red colour'd ſeed is uſeleſſe herein: the round bulbous root of Squils, the ſhavings of mans skull; and Miſſeltoe.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> eryes up Pionie as much as <hi>Cato</hi> did Coleworts, which not onely by an Elementary quality but from the whole ſubſtance of it and ſecret property reſiſts this diſeaſe. And it will raiſe children that fall, becauſe it is not ſo ſtrong in them, if it be but banged about their necks. For it diſcuſſeth and conſumes the flegmatique humour that is the ſeminary of this diſeaſe. Alſo the ſeeds of this given inwardly will do it more effectually in ſuch as are of years. For it drinks up the windy venemous mioſture, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53844:56"/>brings the body to a hotter and dryer temper. Some ſay, this ſeed is the beſt, that comes from the firſt increaſe of the male Pionie. For a long time it brings forth unprofitable ſhoots without ſeed. But when it is of perfect growth, the husks cleave, and in one part you ſhall ſee berries very ſmooth and black; in another, ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of a ſhining ſcarlet red colour. The black ſeed muſt be kept for uſe. Yet not ſo ſuperſtitiouſly, as to hold, that the ſeed of the next year is uneffectual; for that ſeed that comes after ten years, is a preſent remedy if it be not rotten and decay'd.</p>

It chanced, that in my Entry twice a woman fell down ſuddenly as if ſhe had been thunder-ſtricken;<note place="margin">A true Hiſtory.</note> which when I ſaw I came near, and I put a Ring on her finger next her little finger, that had a piece of an Elks claw ſet in it; She preſently aroſe, and drank and went mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily on her way.

For new corruption is bred in the body, and a filthy ſmell accompanies it, as we may perceive by the breath, and this diffuſed in the body vitiates the ſpirits, and extinguiſheth natural heat, for want of tranſpiration. To this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs that ſentence of <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> If there be any remainders in the body or reliques,<note place="margin">

For when there is great plenty of humours, and the corruption is vehement, and the proportion of this is great for putrefaction (for blood is of a hot and moiſt quality, and ſoon corrupts) it falls out that theſe feavers alwaies rage, and ſoon come to their ſtate.

The cauſes of Feavers that come by circuits, and at ſet times are contrary, for they come from ſome force bred in the humour, and by reaſon of place and time, whence it happens that they come with intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that they anted are the time, or come ſlower and later, that they are unſtable and unconſtant, and the fits laſt longer ſometimes.

But for the moſt part this diſeaſe comes at beginning of the ſpring upon thoſe that have alwaies a crudity on their ſtomachs,<note place="margin">Ill to ly upon the back.</note> and that lie often on their backs.

But our night walkers are clean contrary to theſe: for they with their eyes ſhut, walk in the dark and make a great noyſe every where, and ſometimes they are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and go upward and downward, and clamber up to the tops of houſes without any help; which I believe is done by them, by their ſwelling and frothing blood, and by their hot fiery ſpirit, which being carried into the ſeat of the mind, drives on the force and faculties of the ſoul whereby ſhe perfects her functions, and the inſtrumental parts to theſe actions, and moves them to theſe effects.<note place="margin">Hot ſpirits cauſe of motion in ſleep.</note> Whence it comes that the body by the force of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirit which contains the ſtrength of the nervs and muſcles, that is the office of feeling and moving in the brain, and maintains it, is carried upwards, and by the force thereof in ſleep, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to ſuch actions.

And if the humours be not ſo not in ſuch kind of bodies, and the ſpirits are not ſo much ſtirred and troubled, they will onely cry out and leap a little, but they will ſtay in their beds, for the ſpirits are not ſo violent as to raiſe the body.<note place="margin">Lib. de Comit. morb.</note> For whoſoever as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, hath a hot brain, as cholerick and not flegmatick perſons have, theſe will cry and brawl in the night, eſpecially if they do unquietly perform their dayes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and have care of their buſineſſe, having much to do.

                  <p>IT is found by experience in the Low-Countries,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> which <hi>Pliny</hi> alſo teſtifies, that mens bodies when they are drown'd lye on their backs with their faces upwards toward Heaven; but women lye with their faces groveling downwards, and flote with their faces toward the ground. In which Nature is thought to take care of their chaſtity, that their ſecrets may not be ſeen, but be decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concealed. But I think it is becauſe a woman hath a great bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſticking forth, and larger receptacles, and her belly, inteſtines, urinary paſſages are more open, and her breaſts more ſpungy and ſwoln; which becauſe they are fill'd with abundance of humours, the belly is made heavy, and being thus ſtretched with the water, inclines downwards.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A Simile from floting blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note>Which thing we ſee in bladders and veſſels that are ſtopped, that part of them which contains the Ayr flotes upward; but where the water is contain'd, that part is downwards. The ſame you may ſee in an Egg,<note place="margin">An Egg and Ambergreece put into brine will ſwim.</note> that caſt upon ſalt brine will flote, but that part where the weight is, will ſink: but the part filled with Ayr, namely, that which when the ſhell is broken is empty, when they grow old and rotten it will ſwim a top. But unleſſe nature had given larger paſſages and receptacles to this fex,<note place="margin">A woman hath larger paſſages than a man.</note> I pray how could copulation be done? what could help conception and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the child in the womb, for ſecretly by reaſon of this the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix ſwells, and the child growes? what remedy were there for painful labour in child-birth, where the parts muſt be ſtretched forth and dilated, that the child may come forth with more eaſe? what laſtly would ſerve for the childs nouriſhment? unleſſe the womb and entrance of it were ſo made; unleſſe the curious and ſo handſomely ſwelling forth breaſts that are ſo full of millk were made for that uſe? Since therefore a woman hath all her paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and cavities larger, and drinks in much moyſture; it muſt be that that part ſhould ſink downward that is moſt loaded with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But a man hath narrow guts, ſtreight urinary paſſages; and is more endanger'd by the ſtone than a woman is, hath his <hi>abdomen</hi> not ſo much ſtretched out, his hip bones are ſtrong and weighty, his arms are ſtrong, and his ſhoulders large; his back bone is faſt with the ſpondils joyn'd together; his Lungs are hollow and large; whence it is that men have a loud and deep voice,<note place="margin">Why men have a ſtrong voice, and women a ſhrill voice.</note> but women have a ſmall ſhrill voice, becauſe their breaſt is narrow. All theſe things undoubtedly cauſe a man to ſwim on his back, and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man on her belly. For by nature all heavy things fall downwards, and light things upwards. And I think that is the cauſe that men that are drown'd cannot come above water preſently. For when
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53844:60"/>their bodies are full of water, and kept down by the weight of the water, they cannot come up, becauſe there is no ayr in them,<note place="margin">Why men drowned do not riſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</note> and all the ſpirit is driven forth by the abundance of water. But in 7. or 9. dayes the body will flote, for it is diſſolved and corrupts, and the lungs gather much Ayr. Hence it is,<note place="margin">What day men drown'd will ſwim.</note> that our common people uſe to ſay, that on the 9th day when a man's gall is broken he will riſe above water; not that his gall bladder is broken, but becauſe the humours run forth of that and other moyſt parts that are flagging, whence the body when the fleſh is rarified flotes; and the lungs that are hollow like a ſpunge, taking in a great deal of Ayr, raiſe the body above the water: For this part ballances and ſuſtains bodies floting on the water; and the larger lungs a man hath, and the more holes are in them, the longer a man can hold his breath, and ſtay at the bottom of the water a longer time. I heard Dr. <hi>Veſalius,</hi> a man of excellent wit and learning, relate,<note place="margin">A memorable thing of a Moor.</note> that a Moor that was a urinator, was brought to <hi>Ferrat</hi> out of a galley, that could alone continue his voyce longer, and hollow without taking breath, than any four of the ſtrongeſt Men: Again he would ſtop his breath and his noſtrils, and hold his mouth cloſe, and not breathe at all longer than all they could: By which gift of nature he won thus much, that being oft times taken, he ſtill eſcaped, and like a Dydapper he would for half an hour lye at the bottom of the Sea, and ſhake off his yoke of captivity that was more bitter than death. Large capacious Lungs will do thus much for a man, that he ſhall ſoon run a Journey;<note place="margin">What good comes from large Lungs.</note> that if he can ſwim, he can lye longer upon the waters; and if he fall into any deep River he will not be ſo ſoon drown'd; and when he is drown'd he will flote in a few daies. And if theſe bellows of breath be taken out when a man is dead, as I hear ſome Pyrats have done; he will ſtay at bottom and never ſwim up again, becauſe he wants the benefit of the Ayr.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The bodies of thoſe that are drown'd when they ſwim up and come to be ſeen; as of thoſe that are murdered, when their friends are preſent, or the murderers, they bleed at the noſe and other parts of their body.</head>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The dead will bleed.</note>SInce there are many things in Nature that will make us to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: I think this is one of the chief, that blood will run out of the wounds of one that is ſlain, if he be preſent that gave the wound, and is guilty of the murder: and that drowned bodies taken out of the waters, will bleed at ſome parts, if any of their friends be nigh, and the blood is commonly ſo red and lively, as though the faculties and vital ſpirits that agitate the humours were not yet defunct. For that is obſerved by the Magiſtrates and the Rulers of all the Low-Countries, who are wont to be preſent to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of dead bodies, however they came to die, before they be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53844:61"/>buried. But how this ſhould be, it is no eaſie matter for any man to reſolve. I know that in dead people for a time there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a vegetable force, whereby their hair and nails increaſe, imbred moyſture affording nutriment to outward heat. So Plants and ſhrubs cut off, will grow green for ſome dayes, and bear flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers if they chance to be moyſtned with water.<note place="margin">Plants cut up growing for a time.</note> For there is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred force in ſtalks, which they have from the root, and when that is gone, the leafs wither and grow dry and fall off. So it may be that the blood lying hid in the veins may break forth when the body is ſtirred. For we ſee ſuch men carryed up and down by Porters, and to be ſet with their faces ſometimes upwards, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times downwards, and toſſed to and fro. Whence it may be the veins mouths are opened, and the blood that hath not yet put off its natural colour may run out: But from thoſe that are long dead, and late found, not red blood, but bloody corrupt matter runs forth of the wound of him that is ſlain. But if they dyed by a fall, or were lilled by ſomething falling on them, at that part where the paſſages of the body are open, a bloody liquor will run out, namely by the eyes, noſtrils, ears, or nether parts. So commonly we ſee in a fluxible and looſe body, when it hath layn unburied two or three dayes, that a liquor will run forth mingled with blood, when the bearers with much motion carry the bier on their ſhoulders. Alſo Oxen &amp; Bulls when they are ſlain and hang'd up to the beams in houſes, make the pavement bloody with drops of blood; wherefore I conjecture it comes from ſome ſuch cauſe. But this ſeems to be moſt likely,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A</hi> man will bleed ſuddenly from a fright.</note> that the friends of the party ſlain, or he that killed him will bleed at the noſe, by a ſudden fright, when they behold the dead carkaſſe, becauſe the natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and mind happen to be vehemently moved and ſhaken, and the humours do not ſtand ſtill, but flote here and there. For we ſee them ſtrangely affected, and troubled both in their ſpeech and thoughts, and ſometimes they bluſh, ſometimes look pale, and tremble for fear; whence it comes to paſſe, that by long looking on, and being troubled, the blood will break out of their noſtrils whether they will or no. As we ſee the ſame will happen to thoſe who ſuddenly chance to ſee and think on ſome ſad objects, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable things. If any man ſay, that ſympathy, that is, mutual conſent of Nature drawes blood from kindred, and Antipathy and ſecret diſagreement makes the murderers bleed, I am not againſt that.<note place="margin">Blood will wax hot again in dead bodies.</note> But I ſhall more eaſily grant this, that blood will run forth of the wound, though it be bound over with ſwathbands, if he that did the murder ſtand by. For ſo great is the force of ſecret Nature, and ſo powerful is Imagination, that if there be any life left, or the dead body be warm, the blood will boyl, and wax hot by choler kindled in the dead body.</p>

And theſe membranes are not onely different in colour, but in ſhape alſo, either by reaſon of ſome internal or external effect, or from ſome object of the eyes or mind. For when ſome men are ſo laſcivious and given to pleaſure, that without choice, taking no heed of the flowing of the terms, they will uſe copulation with women; it falls out ſometimes that when the terms have run three dayes or thereabout, and there is not much behind, onely a day or two that they have to run more, the natural time is hindred, and ſome part of the excremental flux is kept back by unſeaſonable copulation but yet ſometimes this perfects the conception. When therefore a woman is in the act of generation, and knows that her terms are not yet quite ſtaid, and that ſhe ſhould not yet copulate, the parts being ſtill wet, ſhe ſecretly bluſheth at it, and her eyes are covered with blood: which affect when it paſſeth to the child that membrane becomes of divers colours and faſhions.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The excellency of the finger of the Left hand that is next the little finger, which is laſt of all troubled with the Gout, and when that comes to be affected with it, death is not far off. By the way, wherefore it deſerves to wear a Gold Ring better than the reſt.</head>
                  <p>PHyſitians grant that all parts of the body that are affected with any diſeaſe that comes primarily or by conſent, and law of company, ſince a diſeaſe doth not conſiſt in a diſeaſe, but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is impacted by another to it. As the Proverb is, ſome hurt comes by reaſon of the hurt that is near. But provident nature alwaies defends the principal parts,<note place="margin">Nature fences the princpal parts from the diſeaſe.</note> and ſends the miſchief to the more ignoble parts; which is done critically and by the force of nature, when the collections of humours and diſeaſes, are driven to the remoteſt parts. But if the diſeaſe and its ſymptoms, that is, the affect that ſucceeds it, be ſtrong and violent, and nature be weak and cannot reſiſt it, and bridle the force of it as ſhe would, the humours fall upon the principal parts, as we ſee in the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Lungs, the Pleuriſie, Quinſey, Lethargy, and many more acute diſeaſes, but in the joynt and Hip gowt, that is preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the Spring and Autumn, the force and natural facultie drives the humours heaped up in the body from the ſtronger parts to the weaker. So I obſerved in <hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> that very many were ſubject to the gowt of their hands and feet, all whoſe joynts were ſwoln and in bitter pains,<note place="margin">The ring finger.</note> onely the ring finger of the left hand, that is next the little finger, was free from it: for that by the nearneſſe and conſent of the heart felt no harm. And no man need fear death from this diſeaſe, (for they are free from other diſeaſes, if ſo be they be not troubled with the pox, and ſores that ariſe from that) unleſſe a confluence of humours fall upon the left ſide of the breaſt, under which part lyes the round point of the heart, and the ring finger begin to be knotty and ſwell: For ſo ſoon as this comes, the vital force is weakned, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour fails, and all power of the mind and body ſinks down. Hence the Antients had a cuſtome, to wear a ring of gold on that finger, and to adorn it ſo above the reſt: Becauſe a ſmall branch of the Arterie, and not of the Nerves, as <hi>Gellius</hi> thought,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note> is ſtretched forth from the heart unto this finger, the motion whereof you ſhall perceive evidently in women with child and wearied in travel, and all affects of the heart, by the touch of your for finger. And this may ſeem abſurd to no man; for I uſe to raiſe ſuch as are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in a ſwoond, by pinching this joynt, and by rubbing the ring of gold with a little Saffron, for by this a reſtoring force that is in it, paſſeth to the heart, and refreſheth the fountain of life,<note place="margin">The Phyſick finger.</note> unto which this finger is joyn'd: wherefore it deſerved that honour above the reſt, and Antiquity thought fit to compaſſe it about with gold. Alſo the worth of this finger, that it receives from
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53844:64"/>the heart, procured thus much, that the old Phyſitians, from whence alſo it hath the name of <hi>Medicus.</hi> would mingle their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments and potions with this finger, for no venom can ſtick upon the very outmoſt part of it, but it will offend a man, and communicate it ſelf to his heart.<note place="margin">Jerem. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> And beſides others, <hi>Jeremias</hi> teſtifies, that they were wont of old to wear gold rings on their fore finger.

                  <p>I Have ſeen napkins made and woven of a certain kind of flax that will not burn, nor ever be conſumed by fire: when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are foul and ſhould be made clean, men uſe no Soap or Lye, or Waſh-balls to take out the ſpots, but they caſt them into the fire, and they will flame, as earthen pots that are very greaſie, and become very clean and extream white. This kind growes in the deſarts of <hi>India,</hi> and dry grounds burnt with the Sun: from whence ſome plants by reaſon of the nature of the ground, and the qualities of the outward ayr, become to be of that temper, that they may be wrought and woven into ſhee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For if in the Sea and Rivers Crabs can grow up with hard ſhells, alſo Crafiſh, Looſters, Scallops, and other ſhell-fiſh, in which, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">L. <hi>9.</hi> c. <hi>33.</hi> Corall is taken in the <hi>Ligurian</hi> Sea.</note> Nature hath varied and ſported her ſelf, making them of different colours and ſhapes: and if the Coral ſhrub in the bottom of the <hi>Ligurian</hi> Sea, can grow with boughs, and when it is taken out of the Sea it hardneth to a ſtone; no man can think it improbable, that ſome ſhrubs from the heat of the ground by the Sun, become to be of ſuch a nature, that being bruiſed with clubs,<note place="margin">Ropes made of herbs.</note> and ſoftned with the Workman's hammer, may become ductile, and ſo drawn into threads that fire will not burn. Alſo who will not wonder, that from Hemp, Nettles, Broom, and Flax
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53844:64"/>rinds, Ropes and Cables are made, and alſo Sails and Sheets? for their rinds being tough and tenacious, they may be drawn into ſmall threads, as alſo the pieces and plates of ſilver and gold are. So from theſe twigs (and not from the hair of the Salamander, as ſome fooliſhly imagine) are napkins and linnen cloaths made, as from the Silk-worm and woollen-trees Silks are made, but with greater labour: for the matter is ſtiff, and is not ſo ductil. That kind of Linnen is called <hi>Aſbeſtinum,</hi> from the likeneſſe and nature of Lime that is purged by fire, and is not conſumed, nor ſuffers any loſſe. Like unto this is the ſtone called <hi>Amiantus,</hi> and it reſembleth Sciſſil Allum, commonly called feathery Allum, of which, as <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Indians</hi> make ſheets;<note place="margin">L. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>99.</hi> Volater. l. <hi>22.</hi>

                     <hi>Archilaus</hi> the General of <hi>Mithridates</hi> made proof of this in a woodden Tower, which when <hi>Sylla</hi> ſtrove to fire, he could not do it, and was forced to depart, leaving the buſineſſe undone, becauſe it was all over anointed with Allum that binds exceedingly.

Laſtly, it is ſo weighty, that it will not flote, but ſink down under water preſently, like to Box and Ebeny, that in the native tongue is called <hi>Guaicum,</hi> a wood that is excellent to cure venereal ſores, and the French pox. Yet a man may well wonder that it ſhould not burn and flame, when it ſends forth Roſin of a colour like honey. For as many Trees as ſweat forth Roſin and Pitch, quickly take fire. But the ſolid and compacted hardneſſe of the wood is the cauſe of it, which hath no pores for the fire to get in to burn it by; though <hi>Matthiolus</hi> aſſerts, that the Larch-Tree about <hi>Poe</hi> that grows there plentifully, will ſuddenly take fire.</p>

For this fomentation doth not onely help concoction, but eaſeth all joyntpains; but amongſt whelps which do it moſt effectually.</head>
                  <p>TWo things there be that ſtrengthen our body, and preſerve our life, native heat, and moyſture that is the ſubſtance of imbred heat, and theſe ſtand both in need one of the other. Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is the food and fuel of heat, and heat ſubſiſts by it; which two,<note place="margin">By beat, moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, ſpirit, the body ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts.</note> being full of ſpirit, and united together, do paſſe into the whole body.

But ſince many things are to be obſerved, concerning theſe, and they are obvious amongſt Phyſitians every where: I ſhall let paſſe all ſuperfluous things, and ſpeak onely of ſuch things as being applyed outwardly do lend help unto a man. Amongſt thoſe things that ſtir up and augment natural heat, and eaſe pains, I place Whelps,<note place="margin">Whelps of one colour.</note> not all, but thoſe eſpecially that are of one colour'd hair, and not ſpotted with many divers ſpots on their skins, for theſe not onely foſter imbred heat, but eaſe pains alſo. So in all ſorts of joynt Gowts, of the hands or feet, or elſewhere, there is nothing more ready to aſſwage all pains be they never ſo ſharp, than ſuch whelps laid to the parts affected.<note place="margin">Whelps laid to the parts eaſe pains.</note> For by a ſweet and warm heat, they ſtir up the faint and decaid native heat in man, and by a continual foſtering, they either attract to themſelves the humour that cauſeth the pains, or by a digeſting and diſcuſſing faculty they cut and conſume it. For you ſhall find, that when they are taken away and releaſed, that their joynts will be weak and feeble, and they can hardly ſtand on their legs, the greateſt part of the pain being drawn upon themſelves. But that the skin of one colour all alike is the cauſe of it, and thoſe skins that are of various colours cauſe not the ſame effect; the reaſon is, the equality of their temper, and the uniformity of heat: For the diverſity of colours, is a ſign of the diſtemper, and divers mixture of heat and moyſturo.<note place="margin">A ſimile from grafting.</note> For as grafting muſt anſwer the nature of the Trees; ſo a man in cheriſhing his limbs, muſt apply a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat that is all alike; wherefore if you would ſtrengthen your ſtomach, or any other part, you muſt neceſſarily defend the natural temper of it, and not increaſe the heat too much, or bring any ſtrange heat into it.<note place="margin">Thera. l. <hi>7.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">French Pox, Leproſie, Scurvy.</note>THere are three diſeaſes of kin one to the other, yet are not ſo mortal, as foul and contagious, and theſe change one into the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> the Leproſie, in hogs call'd the Meazels, and the Scurvy. The black Jaundice is a kind of them. Theſe diſeaſes in former years did cruelly torment men; now they are grown gentle, and not ſo troubleſome: This happens,<note place="margin">Diſeaſes grow gentle by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</note> partly, becauſe the force of the miſchief is ſubdued by the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and the cruelty of the humours is aſſwaged; and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Nature by cuſtome is hardned againſt theſe pains. So I have obſerved ſome in their flouriſhing vigorous youth to have been cruelly tortured; but when they grew old they were not ſo much afflicted with it. For either the heating and boyling growes col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the humours flow not ſo much together: or Nature in time accuſtomed to the diſeaſe, and being made familiar, and domeſtick to her, ſhe no longer contends with it; or elſe ſhe is nouriſhed with thoſe vitious humours, and is not offended: For as Sows that wallow in the mud, and Coblers,<note place="margin">A Simile from hogs in the mud.</note> and ſuch as cleanſe Jakes and publick vaults, ſmell no ill ſmell; ſo diſeaſed people are fed with filth. And becauſe they are hardned againſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and diſeaſes of their bodies, that I may not ſay it of their minds, they no longer perceive the detriment that Nature ſuffers: For the diſeaſe being inveterate and faſtned in the very bottom of the marrow, hath taken from them all ſenſe thereof. But at firſt when any ſtrange quality ſeizeth on the body, whereby it corrupts and is changed, what parts ſoever receive ſharp biting humours, they feel pain. But when the diſeaſe growes old, and is grown up with Nature, they feel not much pain, becauſe they agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the humours wax faint by commerce with the body, and keeping company with it, and by the mixture of other humours, they are weakned, as ſtrong Wine is with Water. Yet the footſteps of the old diſeaſe and reliques of it alwaies remain; which if they fall down upon the Lungs they make the ſick hoarſe, and ſhort winded; if it fall on the joynts it makes them ſubject to the Gowt in the feet, hands, hucklebone, and it returns at certain
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53844:66"/>times. So all that have pocky ſores are gowty: But all that have the Gowt in their feet or hips,<note place="margin">All that have pocky ſores have the Gowt, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily.</note> have not the ſymptoms of the Pox. And if the flux of humours is ſent to the outward skin, their skin is made rugged and cruſty, their face is deformed with tetters, ſcabs, foul ſores and ſcurf, and their hair falls.</p>
                  <p>For it falls out with them as it doth with Trees and Twigs, on which piſſe,<note place="margin">A Simile from Trees that are corrupted.</note> or ſome ſalt water or filth is caſt. For when the root is hurt the leafs fall off, and the branches wither: yet the Tree dyeth not at the root, but it decayes, and is hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Inconveniencies of Tippling and drunkenneſse, and what things will reſiſt and cure it.</head>
                  <p>THere is an old cuſtome of force, amongſt the High and low Dutch, that they care for no mans friendſhip or familiarity, but ſuch as can drink ſtrongly with them,<note place="margin">In Curcul.</note> &amp; piſs ſtoutly. Wherefore I thought I ſhould do ſomething conſiderable, to relate ſome things that will reſiſt drunkenneſſe: that every man in that conteſt may look to himſelf, either not to be overcome with Wine, or to be offended but little by it. At firſt let no man drink too much, and be too ready to take up his cups, but let him civily refuſe and draw back, pretending that he is not very well. Sometimes you muſt find out ſome ſtratagems to deceive thoſe that aim at you to make you drunk, and that moſt endeavour to prevail over you. And you muſt take occaſion cunningly to ſteal forth to make water, or to take away the cup, but you muſt be very crafty and ſubtill in doing it &amp; with great dexterity. For if the company find your cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they will ply you the more abundantly. Yet every man may eaſily find out ſome ſhifts to avoid, and wittily to coſen his fellow drinkers. In the mean while let every man conſider well the reward of this inveterate and unworthy cuſtome and errour, and he ſhall ſee as clear as day what hurt it doth to his body and ſoul and ſpirits, to be given to much drinking. For firſt, it not onely hurts memory the moſt pretious faculty of the mind,<note place="margin">Intemperance in Wine hurts the memory.</note> and makes it weak, but totally ruines it, making the eyes dark, and cauſing blindneſſe, the cheeks are blabber'd, and the limbs trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and reel, and many other inconveniencies accompany immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate drinking of wine, and they are all cold diſtempers. Nor, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">De Temp. l. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> doth it alwaies heat a man; but when he drinks more
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53844:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>than he can conquer, it cauſes cold diſeaſes. For the natural heat is extinguiſhed and choaked, juſt as when you powre abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of oyl at once upon a little flame. I do premiſe this that no man ſhould faſlly judge that do give occaſion, or open the dore for ſuch wickedneſſe. For it is my chiefeſt deſire, that men would either drink moderately, or if there fall out an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occaſion to drink much (for as the Proverb is,<note place="margin">A Proverb at bankets.</note> theſe ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot ſtand without it) that they may not want helps to drive away drunkenneſſe: amongſt which I ſet down bitter things, and as many ſuch means as will purge away watry humours by urine. For by this way the fumes are derived from the head, and the Wine is hindred from going into the veins,<note place="margin">Bitter things hinder drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> alſo by their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe they dry up moiſture. So five or ſix bitter Almonds taken before ſupper will perform it effectually. Peach kernels have the like quality with them, and the juice of Peach-leaves preſſed forth, and a little taſter full thereof drank faſting, hath the ſame vertue, alſo the infuſion of <hi>Roman</hi>-Worm-wood, and nutmeg; For all theſe open the paſſages, and make them wide and looſe, as alſo oyl preſſed forth of Olives, or two ounces of oyl preſſed forth of the ſeeds of Seſamum drank in the morning before Sun-riſing: for it makes the belly ſlippery, and extends the urinary paſſages, ſo that drink ſtaies not in the body but paſſeth away continually, if ſo be a man do not burden his ſtomach too much with eating.<note place="margin">'Tis naught for drinkers to eat overmuch.</note> For he that is forced to drink, muſt eat meat but ſparingly: but if he ſhall eat a morſel of bread dipt in honey, he ſhall do well. For honey takes away the force of wine, and blunts the ſharpneſſe of the fumes. Cabbage is better than them all,<note place="margin">Cabbage hinders Drunkenneſſe.</note> which <hi>Cato</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended exceedingly, it is vulgarly called <hi>Caulis,</hi> becauſe no plant hath a greater ſtalk. But of this there are many kinds, and the red cole is beſt to reſiſt drunkenneſſe, if you chew the leaves in your mouth and ſwallow down the juice, or eat them boyl'd for the firſt diſh at table. Yet the ſea-cole,<note place="margin">Sea-cole-worts.</note> and ſea-purſlane that grow plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull by the ſea in <hi>Zealand</hi> are far more effectual; which we uſe in ſallets and ſauces to ſharpen appetite. For they make a man very hungry and thirſty by their imbred faculty. Hence it comes that no fumes or vapours of the wine can riſe to the head, for they are purged out by ſiege and urine. There are many other things of this kind that reſiſt drunkenneſſe, that a man may not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but I cannot reckon all. But if any man chance to be drunk that is not provided with theſe helps (For wine as <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">

For he meant, that moyſt liquid things are the beſt remedy to reſtore ſtrength loſt. For liquid things ſoon refreſh thoſe that are conſumed, which though they nouriſh not ſo much as ſolid meats; yet they are much ſooner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into the body. Wherefore the opinion of <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> is moſt true, and is not contrary to <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> When you eat meat,<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> Celſus explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> it is never good to eat too much; and oft-times too much abſtinence is ill. But if a man be intemperate, it is worſe in drink than meat. Whereby he intimates, that immoderate drinking of wine doth a man more harm, than to glut himſelf with meat. For drink preſently penetrates into all the parts, and goes into the veins undigeſted, and pricks the nerves and brain: But meat ſticks in the ſtomach till it be concocted, and if it be burdenſome, it is eaſily caſt forth by vomit; which is not ſo eaſie and ready for Nature after drink.<note place="margin">Liquid poyſons moſt hurtfull.</note> This is proved by Cats, Dogs, Dormice, Rats, if they eat any morſels that are mingled with poyſon, they eaſily vomit them up, by Natures faculty provoked, which in moyſt things is very hard for them to do; wherefore poyſons given in drink are more dangerous than given in meat, for the venom is ſuddenly carried to all parts of the body and corrupts the vital parts; and if it be drank in wine it deſtroyes the ſooner. But immoderate meat is a dangerous thing to choak a man, and the ſtomach ſo ſwells, and is extended by it, that you would think it would break,<note place="margin">Fat things reſiſt poyſon.</note> eſpecially in thoſe that are hard to vomit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good to uſe moderation in both. But there is nothing more dangerous than a venomous potion, if there be no fat under it: for if there be, the venom paſſeth ſlower into the veins, and doth not altogether lay hold of the vital parts, and it may be caſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53844:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>forth by Vomit ſooner. So when we would prevent venomous potions, we muſt eat butter, oyl, and all fat things; for ſo the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome will not ſtick ſo faſt to the body, and penetrates not ſo ſoon into the veins, and it is ſoon carried forth again by vomit: and ſo they are good againſt drunkenneſſe alſo; but if it ſtay long in the body it corrodes and exulcerates the internal parts, and makes a paſſage to the heart the fountain of life. Wherefore ſo ſoon as one hath taken venome of ſome dangerous meat, repercuſſives, ſowr, ſharp, aſtringent things that bind and ſhut the pores, muſt be avoided, and abovs all things, ſleep.<note place="margin">Sleep is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous after poyſon taken, or when one hath the Plague.</note> For as they that are ſtricken with the plague, when they grow ſleepy, if they do ſleep, they are ſooner dead, and Nature is more ſluggiſh in reſiſting the contagion: ſo in venomous bitings and poyſoned potions, if men fall aſleep, they are in worſe caſe, and the venome ſooner takes hold of the vital parts. Wherefore they muſt be pulled and kept waking, leſt the venome run inwardly toward the principal parts.<note place="margin">An elegant Simile from the Incurſion of an Enemy.</note> For as enemies with little labour and without any trouble almoſt enter Cities and Forts without any reſiſtance, when the Citizens and Watchmen are drunk and dead aſleep; ſo the body of Man when diſeaſes come upon him, or when venomous potions are drank in, can hardly hold out and eſcape, but muſt needs be ſubdued, when the faculties and powers of nature are oppreſſed with ſleep, and are ſluggiſh and idle, and not cheerfull to make oppoſition againſt diſeaſes.

The cauſe of theſe things conſiſts not onely in the capaciouſneſſe of the veins and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles, but in the native heat that is very large, that quickly conquers and conſumes all, and in a ſtrong brain that will not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily admit the vapours.<note place="margin">A ſimile from Glowing iron.</note> For it falls out almoſt with them as with burnt bricks, and glowing hot iron, that is ſometimes ſprinkled with water; or elſe to dry thirſty land.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53844:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>bread well moulded and made with leaven, and well baked is the moſt commendable and healthful food for ſound bodies. Wherefore I would have all men perſwaded, that it is not good to joyn too little bread with their meat.<note place="margin">They that eat little bread their breath ſtinks.</note> For they that eat bread too ſparingly, and fleſh or fiſh plentifully, their body growes ſpungy, and their fleſh looſe, and their breath ſtinks and corrupts. Wherefore eating of fiſh becauſe they ſooneſt corrupt, requires moſt bread with them.</p>
                  <p>We ſee that all meats will ſuddenly corrupt and ſtink, in three days or a little more unleſſe you ſalt them. And Egs, Fiſh, Fleſh, and all ſuch meats will be unſavoury. But bread never corrupts, or ſmells amiſſe. Being over long kept it will grow mouldy, but it putrifies not. Wherefore ſuch as cram themſelves with meats. and eat little or no bread, ſend a ſtinking ſmell from their very entralls, and offend all that are near them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore thoſe that deſire to be of ſtrong and firm conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body, let them eat bread with moderation at leaſt, chiefly when they muſt exerciſe and labour hard. For unleſſe Ditchers, Porters, Marriners, Charriers, Fencers, Wreſtlers, ſhould eat bread in abundance, they could not ſubſiſt, and endure ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But I preſcribe the uſe of bread more ſparingly to tender weak ſickly conſtitutions, and to ſuch whoſe ſtomachs are faint, and the paſſages narrow; It is beſt to refreſh them with liquid meats, and to reſtore their ſtrength, for theſe will ſoon enter the veins. For ſuch bodies are too tender and delicate for to receive hard meats. And the kingly Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſeems to me to have obſerved and conſidered all theſe things very exactly.<note place="margin">

                  <p>So theſe have their generative humour too cold and moyſt, and it runs away from them. For the natural faculties are not able to perfect the ſeed, and make it prolifical.

For the bones are dry, and are nouriſhed by ſuch like nutriment. For ſince the humours, and aliments ſick people take in, grow drie by the heat and drineſſe of the body: the bones wax long, and by reaſon of dry nutriment they ſhoot forth in length, eſpecially when a man is in that age, when his body is moyſt and ductil like clay, and may be drawn forth in length.<note place="margin">A Simile from clay that is duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till.</note> Yet
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53844:73"/>every one hath a certain bounds of his growth, and the limits are ſet for our juſt ſtature, and the means and ways whereby by degrees we ſecretly grow to be handſomely tall, or ill favour'd: and that force of growing in length is ſeldome extended beyond twenty five years of age,<note place="margin">How long time men grow in tallneſſe.</note> and commonly ceaſeth under nineteen years old. Whence it is that teeth ſtruck out will not come again after that date of years, nor will bones broken, and cartilages conſolidate, becauſe they are made of the ſeed of the Parents. But to grow fat and groſſe is not limited to certain times, but as we eat or drink in abundance. Which may be done when a man is in his ſtanding or declining age. For though a man eat abundantly he will not grow tall,<note place="margin">One force cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth tallneſſe, another breadth</note> but ſquare and groſſe. For there is one facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that nouriſheth the body, and another that augments it: For that conſiſts in the plenty of of nutriment: but that about the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid part of the body, namely the bones, nerves, cartilages, &amp;c. Which if they increaſe and grow long, the body increaſeth alſo, though it conſume and waſt away.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore nature in producing of bones, whence length comes uſeth the force of heat, whereby ſhe dries the humours a little, and fits the aliments to feed the bones. For augmentation cannot be made without plenty of nutriment. For when a Creature is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated it requires to be augmented till it comes to its full growth, and to ſpread in length and breadth.</p>
                  <p>Then, to make it continue and laſt the reſt of its life to come, nutrition doth its office, that what decayes may be reſtored, and what the qualities of the ambient Ayre conſume may be repaired, yet the body growing nothing bigger thereby, or longer. Wherefore the augmenting faculty is that that draws forth the bones of men in Feavers like Wax, by the heat and vertue of the ſeminal excrement, which in the vigour of years is very forcible and effectuall to do this. But if children and young men uſe to eat milk from their Cradles, and to uſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, they grow longer,<note place="margin">What things make the body increaſe.</note> and more perſonable; For by uſing to drink Milk, the bones are fed, becauſe it is very like to ſeed, and good blood well concocted: by the uſe of fruits; the Nerves; of water, the fleſh; as we may ſee in Oxen that grow fat where much water is, and in moiſt grounds they augment and grow greater.</p>

But ſince there uſe to be infinite queſtions moved concerning this matter, I ſhall determine all in a few words; whether it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to open a vein, When men are faſting or full. For ſince I ſee many tremble and fear when a vein muſt be opened, leſt they ſhould ſwound or faint, I think it fit to give them ſome meat, and a little ſtrong wine. For I have often obſerved ſome frequently to fall down in a ſwound, and not to move, and could hardly with ſmels and pulling them be recovered.<note place="margin">Meat and drink feed the ſpirits.</note> Add to this that blood runs not together, and plentifully when people are faſting, but faintly and by degrees, and ſometimes it will not come forth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature greedily keeps back the treaſure of life, and will not eaſily let it go, becauſe that ſhe finds the greateſt force of ſpirits to be in it: which being exhauſted the whole body pines away, and the works of nature are performed worſe than they were. But when ſome nutriment is given,<note place="margin">Meat to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before blood letting.</note> it will run forth more readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the ſpirits are quickned by eating, and much cheered by drinking and moderate exerciſe, and the blood runs all over the body, and makes it more ruddy and well colour'd. But it is a queſtion whether it be fit to ſleep preſently after bloud-letting.<note place="margin">Whether we may ſleep after a vein opened.</note> I, unleſſe one be uſed to it, or be weary with heat and long travell do not think it fit or good for ones health in the ſpring and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to ſleep at noon, nor do I think it good for to ſleep preſently after opening a vein, eſpecially if ones belly be full, or his body fat.<note place="margin">After blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> For ſome of theſe are of opinion that after blood-letting they ſhould reſtore their ſtrength by cramming themſelves with meat and drink.

But Phyſiognomy, which by the face, eyes, countenance, lineaments, and the whole habit diſcovers the propenſion of the mind and body, is in no part of it to be referred to unlawfull arts, for the moſt excellent men were very ſtudious in it, and carefull to adorn it. But ſince there is no part of the body, though never ſo ſmall, baſe, and ignoble, that offords not ſome argument of the imbred nature, and to what the mind is inclined, yet the chief marks and tokens appeare in the face and countenance, and which is the moſt certain diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the mind, in the volubility and aſpect of the eyes. For in them do ſhine, hate, anger, Indignation, fear, hope, joy, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, arrogance, jealouſy, covetouſneſſe, aemulation, and all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall affections of the mind, in the outward habit of the body.

Their ſtanding, going, lying down, their countenance, eyes, hands, motion, ſerve all to expreſſe an honeſt and comely mind; as alſo in the face, wiſdome, honour, honeſty and other vertues appear.</p>
                  <p>But though all things do not exactly anſwer the praedictions of this art, and many things fall out contrary to the marks that are outwardly on the body, and that either by reaſon of education, or the Induſtry of Parents, or elſe by the grace of God: yet for the moſt part they are true, and the event is certain. For in ſuch as are marked with ſome viſible note, Art finds out the truth.<note place="margin">Notes of the body ſhew the condition of the Mind</note> For where there is an errour about ſome principal part, there the mind partakes of ſome inconvenience, and cannot perfectly perform her offices. So they that are deformed with a bunch-back, ſo it be a natural Infirmity, and not accidental, nor come by any fall or blow, are commonly wicked and malitious; becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation is communicated to the heart, that is the fountain and beginning of life. Next to theſe are ſquint, blind, blear-ey'd people, and ſuch as have rolling eyes, and ſuch as caſt their eyes aſide; becauſe Nature failed about the brains. But deaf, mute, ſtuttering, ſtammering people, and ſuch as cannot ſpeak plain by reaſon of the weakneſſe of the nerves and muſcles, are not free from vice, yet they do not deſerve to be much blamed for it. For the leſſe noble and generous the part is, that is ſubject to errour, the principle parts are the leſſe affected thereby. But if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of the body be near the heart or the brain,<note place="margin">The heart and brain are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the remote parts.</note> and partake with them, ſome errour is communicated thereby to the mind and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; ſo that they are not ſound in all their perfections, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the rule of Judgment fails and is carried obliquely; ſo that the animal faculties cannot perform their functions and offices as they ſhould. Yet it is not alwaies neceſſary, nor doth it follow, that the condition of mans nature, his manners, ſtudies, purpoſes, propenſions of his mind and agitation thereof ſhould be fitted to the outward marks, and to be meaſur'd by the external lineaments and ſigns of his body. For men do act and meditate, and conceive many things in their minds, and perform the ſame in their actions, whereof there is no print or note at all to be ſeen on their bodies, or any thing to conjecture by. For a man may be deformed in his body and his limbs ſtand awry, and yet he may be upright and enclined to noble arts. And on the contrary a man may have a

                  <p>MAny think it is beſt to ſleep with their mouths wide open; For ſo the fumes and fuliginous vapours can breathe forth the better, and that the breath can more freely paſſe out and in, and will not ſmell ſo ſtrong; for they that ſleep with their mouthes ſhut, have an ill ſented and ſtinking breath. But I am other wiſe perſwaded. For as lying on the back is hurtfull to the Lungs and midriff, ſo that they will ſwell with humours powred on them; ſo to ſleep with open mouth is naught for ones health. For the Lungs being full of holes, draw in abundantly by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call artery, the obvious Ayre, which in the night is commonly impure and troubled: wherewith the paſſages of breathing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtuffed,<note place="margin">More whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to ſleep with the mouth ſhut.</note> makes the voice hoarſe or blunt. But when the mouth is ſhut, the breath and outward Ayre, comes in and goes out not by heaps but by degrees by the windings of the noſtrills, and by a turning revolution, and ſo paſſeth to the lungs, and tempers the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53844:75"/>heat of the heart. And hence it is that ſuch as ſleep with their mouths ſhut are not ſo thirſty.<note place="margin">Whence comes thirſt in the night.</note> For they that ſleep with their Jaws extended, by reaſon of their breath, and the Ayre toſſed to and fro, have their tongues and palates dry, and deſire to be moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by drinking in the night. But ſince this opinion may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many ſolid reaſons, yet there is none more prevalent, than that the concoction in the ſtomach is far better performed by it, if any man ſleep with his mouth ſhut: for the natural heat is more preſerved and concocts more ſtrongly.<note place="margin">A ſimile taken from the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin.</note> For as pots and ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles that are to boyl meat in, will ſooner boyl it, if they be cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe no heat of vapour comes forth: ſo heat in mans body kept in and covered will ſooner digeſt the meat.

                  <p>THe Nature of mortall men is fallen into ſo great cruelty, all humanity being laid aſide, that they are not onely barbarous to ſtrangers, but they are cruell to their own children, to whom they ſhould wiſh all proſperity. For who doth not hear daily in the ſtreets and villages their terrible and execrable curſes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they moſt inhumanely curſe their children to the pit of hell, and pray for all miſchiefs to fall upon them: and I remember that many of them have taken effect, and come to a miſerable and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable end.<note place="margin">L. <hi>7</hi> de Leg.</note> Wherefore <hi>Plato</hi> thinks nothing more dangerous than for Parents to curſe their children.

                  <p>THere is an upinion that is of long continuance, and a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Low-Countries, that is commonly objected againſt ſuch as recover of a long diſeaſe.<note place="margin">No man is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</note> That no man is made better for a dangerous diſeaſe, or a long journey. And it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls out ſo. For ſuch is the nature of mortall men, that though they be vexed with long diſeaſes, and are toſſed with dangerous and hazardous voyages both by Sea and Land, and wandring up and down, when they chance to eſcape, they ſoon forget all, and they begin to live more looſely and licentiouſly, that they are worſe than they were before, and the time paſt was better than what comes after.<note place="margin">Math. <hi>12.</hi> Doctrine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God, makes the beſt manners.</note> This I ſuppoſe happens becauſe the mind of man is much neglected, and the inward man is not manured as it ſhould be, for good education would root out imbred errours and vitious affections, namely the love and confidence in God, and the knowledge of his word, unto which the will and reaſon are made ſubjects, and ſo all his actions are framed by that rule. For theſe things would effect and bring to paſſe, that we ſhould forſake thoſe ſins, which when we were ſick and in danger, we ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced: otherwiſe all the fair promiſes we made, and our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of amendment of life, and many more vows that we then made, become void and of no moment. For when we are reſtored to our former ſtrength, nature falls back to her damnable cuſtoms, and will not alter. Wherefore and honeſt courſe of life and a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of doing as we ſhould,<note place="margin">The heavenly word is the food of our ſouls.</note> that we had in our minds, can by no other means be brought to perfection, but by the word of God, and the influence of his ſpirit, which if when the diſeaſe is gon, it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53844:76"/>ſtay faſt in our minds, we ſhall not eaſily fall away from our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of amendment of life, which pain extorted from us not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſecret inſpiration: but we ſhall ſtick conſtantly unto it, though many things do ſollicite us to fall from it. There is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Epiſtle extant of <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 7.</note> wherein he ſaith he was advertiſed by the ſickneſſe of a friend; that we are beſt when we are faſtned by diſeaſes to our beds. For he that is ſick, if he be tempted by luſt or covetouſneſſe, he will not be amorous or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, he neglects honours and riches, he is lowly and not ſo fierce, and laſtly, he reſolves to lead a harmleſſe happy honeſt ſober life,<note place="margin">That the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the mind may come to a happy iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</note> if he chance to eſcape. Wherefore he took occaſion from hence to admoniſh both his friend and himſelf, that when they are well they ſhould perſevere to be ſuch, as they promiſed to be when they were ſick. This exhortation was good and commendable. But he knew not, nor could he ſhew, by whoſe conduct help and inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration this was to be effected. For unleſſe we are ſuſtained by the power of God and his word, upon every light occaſion we ſhall fall back to our former errours, and the floud of humane affairs will carry us another way, and not to an honeſt &amp; innocent life, and good and unblameable manners. For it was he infirmity of man that wreſted from us the promiſes of leading a better life,<note place="margin">Why is it that ſome are made better.</note> and not faith or any ſolid doctrine founded on Gods word. But if any man ask for a natural reaſon, there is none that ſeems to me more probable, than that when men recover of their diſeaſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny witty merry companions come to ſee them, and they invite them to rejoyce, and make merry, and to fall into all kinds of Luxury and deceitfulneſſe of pleaſures and dalliances.</p>
                  <p>Hence they eat, and drink healths one after another round about, and ſo they gratify them that are reſtored to their former health; and commonly there they ſing bawdy ſongs; and ſuch things, that are not fit to be ſeen or heard, are repreſented. Theſe things and many ſuch like do eaſily draw a ſick and dubious mind that hath quickly forgot its deliverance, to embrace what is worſe. To this I add the delicate and voluptuous meats, which the humours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing augmented by, do ſtimulate and prick the obſcene parts with,<note place="margin">Delicate meats foment luſt.</note> and cauſe erection. Hence it is that they return to luxury and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, and profuſe luſts, and whorings, and unbridled pleaſures; ſo,</p>

Now there is nothing that turns a man more from God, and alienates him
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53844:77"/>from his maker, than proſperous ſucceſſe and abundance of all things:<note place="margin">Proſperity makes us ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</note> onely affliction calls us to repentance and mourning, and to a purpoſe of a better life. And no man can be perſwaded that God is diſpleaſed with his way of living or that his manners and cuſtomes and ſtudies are not approved by him, unleſſe his mind be afflicted with ſome grief and ſadneſſe, and his body with ſome diſeaſes. For the mind is ſo deaf to all wholeſome admonitions and counſels, and the underſtanding is ſo hardned with the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ſin, that it will either reject milder corrections, or not be much moved by them, and there appears no hopes of amendment unleſſe more ſharp remedies be applied.

So God, provoked by the continuance of ſin and daily cuſtome of doing wickedly, holds back his hand from ſmiting them, and ſuffers them to fall, and run to all diſgrace, infamy, reproach, and to obey their luſts. By which erroneous life, they firſt get a troubleſome and reſtleſſe mind, than which nothing can befall a man more lamentable and miſerable, then beſides their unhappy end and bitter death, wherein they have nothing to ſupport them, they paſſe to eternall puniſhment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable torments.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Stones or Jewels dug forth of the Earth, or taken out of the Sea, or out of the bodies of living Creatures, what vertue they have, and by what means they perform their operations.</head>
                  <p>BOth reaſon and experience prove that ſtones and Jewels have great vertues, ſo they be not counterfeit, and artificial ſtones. Wherefore to wear a ring or a Jewel that hath a handſome and effectuall ſtone ſet in it, is good for the eyes to look on, and is healthfull for the body by the vertue that proceeds from it, and that not onely by a hidden and ſecret faculty, which it hath from the ſtars, as <hi>Marſilius</hi> thinks, but from a vertue that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of it,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude from Jewels.</note> that recreates the vitall ſpirit. For as Jewels are clowded by the ambient ayre, and receive in a groſſe vapour, and abundance of fumes; ſo they do ſend out of them a thin and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible vertue. For though a Jewel be a ſolid body, yet natural heat, and touching and rubbing it, draws forth the force within it, and communicates it to the brain and heart: For a Jewel called <hi>Erananos,</hi> vulgarly a <hi>Turquois,</hi> doth change often, and wax pale and loſe its natural colour, as I have often ſeen it; where he that wears it is ſick or not in good health, and as the body grows well, ſo will this ſtone revive, and will repreſent a moſt amiable sky-colour, as in the cleareſt day, from the temperament of its native heat.<note place="margin">Polluted people deſile Jewels.</note> And there is ſcarce any Jewel but will change colour, if a man be intemperate, or not continent as he ought to be. For their inward vertue periſheth, and all their beauty and luſtre is defiled. Whence it is that he that commits adultery or defiles the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bed, and all that run a whoring, can never keep their Jewels beautiful and perfect, but they are clowdy, and dark by the foul vapours they contract from thoſe that wear them, and from whores whoſe company they frequent. For they draw ſome venemous qualities to them from corrupt bodies that exhale ſuch virulent vapours, and infect them: as women when they have their courſes will foul a clean looking-glaſſe. But if Jewels were ineffectual and of no vertue,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Moſes</hi> would not ſo accurately, and diligently have commanded to adorn the Prieſts veſtment, which they call <hi>Rationale,</hi> with twelve Jewels, whereof both <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> make mention: wherein he would not have men to obſerve the beauty, and alluring rarities of the colours, but the wonderfull force and effects of them alſo, concerning which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe other men have ſpoken ſo largely, I ſhall ſpeak of ſtones that are taken out of the bodies of Animals, birds and fiſhes, whereof many of them ſtick in the ſtomach, and ſome in the head of them. When Autumn begins, and the Moon increaſeth, there is a ſtone taken out of the belly of a Swallow,<note place="margin">The Swallow-ſtone.</note> called a Swallow-Stone, or
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53844:78"/>
                     <hi>Chelidonius</hi> from the bird it comes from, this is a preſent remedy againſt the falling ſickneſſe: for it dryes exceedingly and drinks up the viſcous and clammy moiſture that is the root of this diſeaſe. For the ſwallow, whoſe dung blinded <hi>Tobias</hi>'s eyes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tob.</hi> 2.</note> is of a hot and dry nature, whence it is that they make their neſts ſo artificially of moyſt and ſoft mud, and hang them up in arched and vaulted places. For by touching of it they conſume the moyſture and make the mud hard. Hence it is that Phyſitians make Cataplaſms of them, and find the powder of burnt ſwallowes to be moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in diſſolving the quinſey, and other ſwellings of the throat. Alſo ſnails that are very great, yield unto white, ſomething long, rough,<note place="margin">The Snail-ſtone what vertue it hath.</note> and hollow ſtones in their lower part, which I uſe to take out of their heads, and to keep them for many uſes. For they cauſe one to make water that hath the ſtrangullion, and being bruiſed, and their powder given in wine, they make the urinary paſſages ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and give eaſe. That kind of ſtone grows of a clammy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſlippery humour, which makes an eaſie paſſage for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: and ſo do theſe ſtones help in childbirth, for they dilate and looſen the places, and cauſe the matrix to open wider: but one or two of them put under the tongue, hath a ſtrange force to cauſe ſalivation. Wherefore I adviſe ſuch as are thirſty and dry to role one of them in their mouths. For it will make the tongue moiſt and run with humour, and ſtay both heat and drieth. Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall is of the ſame vertue, if a while ſteeped in cold water it be put into the mouth. Amongſt hearbs, Purſlane, Cucumbers, Houſleek, commonly called Jupiters beard, do the ſame. Alſo Toads yeild a ſtone, that ſometimes repreſents the picture of that Creature, but they are very old,<note place="margin">A Toad-ſtone.</note> and have layn hid a long time amongſt reeds, or amongſt thorns and buſhes, before the ſtone grows in their head, or comes to any magnitude. And there is a Toad ſtone kept and preſerved in the family of the <hi>Lemnians,</hi> that is bigger than a ſmall nut, which I have often proved, that it will diſcuſſe ſwellings and tumours ariſing from venemous beaſts, if you oft rub the places with it. For it hath the ſame nature the toad hath, that it will draw forth and conſume all venome. For if a Rat, Spider, Waſp, black Betle, or rere-mouſe, faſten upon the part and hurt it, our country folks preſently run to this remedy, and by rubbing the place with this ſtone, the pain is abated, and the ſwelling allayed. There are alſo many kinds of Fiſh that have exceeding hard ſtones in their heads, as the Sea-wolf, the Coracinus, Umbrae, the river-Pike, the Muller, and Haddock, whereof there is great plenty in winter. The Low-Countries call them <hi>Schelviſch</hi> from the rough ſcaly skin it hath. For thoſe that are called from the form of their body and aſh-colour, Aſells, or Coo-fiſh, are for the moſt part without theſe ſtones, eſpecially the females<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for out of the head of a male I took a white ſtone, that was like the keel of a ſhip on the lower ſide. All theſe kinds bruiſed and given in wine, eaſe the cholick, and break the ſtone of the reins, not onely by their weight and heavineſſe, as ſome think,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53844:79"/>but by an imbred property, whereby they diſcuſſe and diſſipate the collection of humours.<note place="margin">A ſtone is taken out of the head of a Carp.</note> The triangular ſtone of a Carp pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, will ſtop the blood that runs out of the noſtrills, by its great aſtriction, which you may perceive alſo by taſt.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the events of dreams, and how far they ought to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and believed.</head>
                  <p>SInce of old time men were wont to obſerve dreams with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible vanity and ſuperſtition, and to credit and believe them; The great and good God that would have no man troubled in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtfull and uncertain things, that diſturb the tranquillity of the mind, forbad that no man ſhould be curious in obſerving them, and make raſh interpretations upon them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.</note> and fain doubtfull events. For by theſe impoſtures, many have fallen from God, and turned to falſe worſhips. And if God when we are aſleep, doth warn our minds that are dull to ſeek out what his will is, and doth put into our ſouls ſuch things as were good for the ſalvation of them, and are agreeable to his word and doctrine; theſe things muſt needs be of great concernment, and to be received with great reverence: for by them he ſhews unto us what he requires, and what he would have us do concerning his glory or our own profit, and the good of our neighbour.<note place="margin">God ſometime ſends dreams.</note> But it is fit to examine and obſerve them, and no law forbids ſuch things as are within the compaſſe of natural reaſon, yet ſo that we muſt not faſten and reſt firmly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; for oft-times our conjectures have not the deſired end. For Imaginations and ſuch repreſentations as we ſee in dreams,<note place="margin">Natural dreams to be obſerved.</note> are rayſed from the concourſe of the ſpirits and motion of vapours, which if they be groſſe, thick, and many, either we dream not at all, or the mind diſcerns and perceives them very confuſedly, and darkly. As we ſee in men that are drunk, or ſuch as ſleep deeply after they have been much wearied. Hence it is that dreams are oft troubleſome and obſcure. For when, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues from the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> that part of the mind that partakes of reaſon is faint and faſt aſleep,<note place="margin">De divinat.</note> and the other part is ſtupified with immoderate drinking or eating: we ſee in our ſleep filthy terrible and horrid viſions, as if we were at copulation, or killing beaſts or men, or to be wickedly defiled with bloud, and to do many impure, raſh, and impudent actions. But they that lye down after moderate eating, that part of the mind wherein reaſon conſiſts, and counſel, being chearfull and ready, and the body not being dejected with too little meat, nor oppreſſed with too much, then will it come to paſſe that the mind will ſhine forth, be live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſharp in dreams, and peaceable and true dreams are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53844:79"/>unto it. For what work ſoever man is buſied about in the day, when his body falls aſleep, that the mind will be intent upon and run over again; which <hi>Claudian</hi> in an elegant copy of verſes expreſſed.<note place="margin">L. <hi>3.</hi> praefat.</note>

                     <l>On what by day our ſenſes chance to light,</l>
                     <l>When that we ſleep, we ſee the ſame by night.</l>
                     <l>The Huntſ-man when he reſts, his mind then roves</l>

                     <l>And as by day the miſer hunts for wealth.</l>
                     <l>And he that thirſts as ſtanding on the brink</l>
                     <l>Of Rivers, then believes that he doth drink.</l>
                     <l>And I in ſilent night am wont to muſe,</l>
                     <l>Of divers Arts that in the day I uſe.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And indeed when the body is in a good temper, we ſee in out ſleep no other viſions and apparitions, then ſuch actions and things that we are buſied about in the day time. But if our ſleep be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, and not quiet, but unequal and troubleſome, we are then perplexed with ſuch dreams and viſions that are troubleſome and unuſual; and this ſhews that our bodies abound with groſſe humours, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, or the ſpirits with in are troubled.<note place="margin">Di tuend. vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So drunken and feavouriſh people uſe to be diſquieted with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd dreams, ſo that many think they ſee terrible viſions,<note place="margin">Dreams of ſick men and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</note> hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, Ghoſts, ſcritch-Owls, Harpies, and what is peculiar to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholique people, dead men, and ſorrowfull and ſowre faces.

                  <p>Wherefore Phyſitians ſhall not loſe their labour, if they enquire now and then of ſick people how they ſlept in the night; and what they dreamt of. For dreams ſhew the diſeaſes and affects of the body. For if any man dream that he roles in filth and dirt, it ſhews that his body is full of corrupt naughty humours; but if he dream he hath been in gardens amongſt ſweet flowers and hearbs, it is a ſign that the humours of his body are very pure and clean.</p>

And thereupon that is called the Climac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tericall year, becauſe beginning from 7, it doth as it were by ſteps finiſh a mans Life. And therefore all thoſe years that ariſe by 7, or 9, are called decretory or judiciall, wherein men undergoe great mutations, for either they uſe to be calumniated, or vexed with grievous diſeaſes, or be in great dangers, or do ſuffer ſome detriment or loſſe, either of their goods or health: wherefore I uſe to obſerve the revolutions of theſe years in all ages, ſo that I have found young Boys and Children to be in danger about the fourth year, 7, yeare, 9, or 14, year. For all Children as <hi>C. Celſus</hi> ſaith, are in danger about the 14,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> day, and then at 7, years, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards about 14. years, when haire begins to come forth on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. I know many that were in danger at 21, and after that at 28. and were never free from ſome dangerous diſeaſe after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of 7, or 9, years: which revolution of years, though it be not to be obſerved too ſtrictly or ſuperſtitiouſly by Chriſtians, or to be feared, yet we are not forbid about thoſe times to be moderate and ſparing in our diet, and courſe of Life, leſt humours ſhould be heaped up in our bodies,<note place="margin">Yeares not to be ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved. Why Climacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall years are dangerous.</note> that may in theſe years prove to be the fuell, and matter of diſeaſes. But no man as yet hath explained the reaſon, why diſeaſes in theſe revolutions of years ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be more fierce. I think it comes ſo to paſſe, becauſe the body of Man in certain periods of years heaps up a great heap and collection of humours, by the motion and agitation whereof diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are cauſed. For when Nature comes to immoderate reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Veſſells cannot endure the plenty of humours, they muſt needs break out into a diſeaſe.<note place="margin">How to avoid the danger of the climacteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call year.</note> Wherefore we muſt do all we can to evacuate the peccant matter that abounds, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the Spring or <hi>Autumn,</hi> is to be done either by opening a Vein or Purging. For thus you ſhall not need to fear any diſeaſe after 7 years, or any other year that the climactericall year falls upon, or to be endanger'd by any mutation ariſing thence. From
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53844:80"/>this obſervation of years there hath been a long cuſtome in many Countries, that the Lord of the Manor makes new Agreements with his Tenant every 7, year.<note place="margin">A ſimile from lopping of Trees</note> For the ſame cauſe woods of Willow, Birch, Alder, white and Black Poplar, and all Trees that are of ſoft moiſt wood, are wont to be cut down every fourth year: but ſuch as are of hard wood, as Oaks, Holm, Timber, Elms, Aſh, are to be lopt and cut every 7, or 9, years.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Judiciall days.</note>In like manner Phyſitians obſerve criticall days, which, if a man ſhall exactly obſerve the accompt as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath ſet it down, he ſhall ſeldome miſſe or fail in his praedictions.<note place="margin">The Criſis or judgement of diſeaſes.</note> A Criſis is a ſudden change in the diſeaſe, either to Life or Death, which is wont to be terminated either on the 4th, or 7th, or 9th, or 11th, or 14th, day. Some referr the decretory days to the operation of the Moon, ſo Aſtrologers judge of diſeaſes. When the Moon is in the degrees that are remote a quarter or halfe a great Circle that ſhe was in when the diſeaſe firſt began. But ſhe comes to theſe <hi>Radii,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Starrs do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſooner, ſomtimes later, as her courſe is ſwifter or flower. The <hi>Criſis</hi> is not to all men alike, becauſe mens Natures are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and their ages, and the conſtitutions of their bodies, and the Aſpects of the other Stars to the Moon. If on the judiciall day, the Moon be in her Houſe, or Exaltation with <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> that are gentle and heathfull Planets, it foreſhews a good <hi>Criſis.</hi> If the diſeaſe conſiſts in plenty of humours; it is good if the Moon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in a quartile or oppoſite Aſpect. But if at the ſame times the Moon be in Conjunction with the Sun, or <hi>Saturn,</hi> it is no good omen, and ſhews the diſeaſe will be dangerous or Chronicall. But if the Moon decreaſing accompany <hi>Saturn,</hi> when the diſeaſe begins, it ſhews it will be Chronicall or Mortall: But if that happen when the Moon increaſeth, it is a ſign the diſeaſe will ſoon begon, and is not dangerous. But as I would not have the healthfull and hurtfull ſignes of the Stars, to be neglected, ſo I think it not good to be ſuperſtitiouſly tied unto them; but rather to build on <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> his obſervations, which ſeemed to me to be alwaies more certaine, and not ſo doubtfull and deceitfull, if ſo be a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly conſider all things. Therefore I referr this reaſon of criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call days, not ſo much to the Starrs, as to the nature of the diſeaſes and bodies, with the qualities and plenty of humours. For Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wreſtles with the diſeaſe, and labours to caſt it off: And if ſhe be dull or weak in reſiſting the fury of it, the conflict ends the firſt time, either on the 7th, or 9th, or at the utmoſt on the 14th, day. For the like hapneth to thoſe bodies,<note place="margin">A ſimile from a City beſieged.</note> as doth to a City that is moſt ſtraightly beſieged, which being not well provided with all things needfull, and ſuch things as ſhould ſerve to keep off the Enemies, cannot endure the leaſt oppoſition, but after one or two batterings, fails, and is taken by the adverſary. And as ſomtimes the battering of it is ſtaid, by a parley or time to breathe in, and then the enemy comes on again with greater force, ſo it falls out commonly in acute diſeaſes, wherein we obſerve the force of the diſeaſe, like tempeſts and great winds to be ſtill a while,<note place="margin">A ſimile from Tempeſts.</note> but it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53844:81"/>comes again with ſuch violence, that Nature can hardly endure, nor life continue untill 7 days be expired.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the force of the 7th, number is obſerved in many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, and Divines are perſwaded of the great vertue of it: Phyſitians have principall cauſe accurately to obſerve it, for daily experience ſhews that in health and ſickneſſe, in the revolution of days,<note place="margin">The 7th, number Sacred.</note> months and yeares, and for the judgment of diſeaſes, it is of great concernment.

                  <p>Alſo this is the profit, the uſe of a Glaſſe may make unto us, that it may ſharpen our eyes, that are grown dull by continuall poring, and help to recover and refreſh our weary ſight. For the viſuall Spirits are gathered together, and are recreated by new Spirits that reſult from the brain;<note place="margin">What good a Glaſſe may do the eyes.</note> But many doubt how it is that a Glaſſe ſhould repreſent the image of that ſtands over againſt it. For ſome think the images are in the Glaſſe, that is, the figures of our bodies ſent forth from our bodies: others think the images are not in the glaſſe, but that we ſee them in the reflected ſight, that is beat back again upon it ſelfe. Wherefore Glaſſes ſhew many things by reflected beams. For reflexion is from thick bodies,<note place="margin">Why a Glaſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the form of what is over againſt it.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Glaſſes are foild on the backſide, that the light may not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate directly through them. But the oppoſite body appeares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that part of the radius that moves the eye, is directed to the oppoſite body; wherefore the whole radius is received as ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out unto that part, and thence it follows, that the thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the eye. But they repreſent the Images with that part that is againſt one, and not with that which is turn'd from us; becauſe the ſpecies which paſſeth from a ſolid body to the ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Glaſſe through the Aire, is pure and ſimple: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the images ſhine in the Glaſſe, when as light <hi>radii</hi> are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from it; for they being beat back, come home to the eye, in which it ſees it ſelfe, and every one doth behold his image clearly. For we do not ſee through the Glaſſe, nor is the image formed in the Glaſſe, but in the eye, but the Glaſſe helps by ſtriking back the ſight. And this is the reaſon why, when we riſe in the night, we behold the light at firſt looking on it, as if the rays went from us, and looked towards themſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon themſelves. Hence you may collect why the right parts of the body are made the left in the Glaſſe,<note place="margin">A ſimile from Seals.</note> and the left the right; For it falls out as it doth with Tables of Wax or Clay, upon which, if you ſtamp the print of your Seal, in the taking off, the parts ſtand contrary.<note place="margin">A ſimile from the Printers letters.</note> The ſame we ſee in Printing-Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in places that are caſt with rawe pictures, without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of colours or painting, for there the right parts alwaies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the left of the mole.

                  <p>THere was invented in the memory of former ages, an art of diſtilling, for the uſe and preſervation of mans health, and to drive away ſickneſſe, whereby we diſtill from hearbs, juices, and Phyſicall liquors, which, though it be certain that they have not ſo much vertue and force as the Infuſion and decoction of the hearbs themſelves, or the juice preſſed forth, yet are they not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be rejected, as they are by ſome men. Nor muſt we judge them to be altogether uneffectual and vain; for the quality and force of them is not totally loſt &amp; aboliſhed, which may be proved, as by many things, ſo by Aquavitae, or as ſome commonly call it ſpirit of wine,<note place="margin">A Limbeck or Still.</note> or ſublimed, which ſometimes is drawn from the beſt wines, but oft-times, from the lees of any ſmall dead ſowre wines by a Still in a furnace, with a gentle fire. For oft-times I made trial of the wonderfull force of it.<note place="margin">The force of Aqua-vitae.</note> For let the froſt be never ſo cold and ſharp that liquor will never freeze, nor become Ice, ſo that writing Ink and many more things that have ſome drops of this mingled with them will never be frozen, and this come from the exceeding heat and thinneſſe that it hath. And if you would try whether this quinteſſence be pure and without mixture,<note place="margin">How to try A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua-vitae.</note> wet a Table-cloath or linnen Towel with that liquor, and put it to the flame; if it burn
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53844:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>preſently and do not touch nor hurt the linnen, it is pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed. For linnen wet in this water will flame and not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. For the flame will but gently lye upon the fineſt linnen, and not take hold of it, but licks up all that is next of kind to it, namely that liquor that is like it, and of a fiery nature. And if you put a little of it into the hollow of your hand, and put flame to it with a burning paper, the palm will be hot, but the hand will not burn.<note place="margin">How melted lead ſhall not burn you.</note> But if you waſh your hands with the juice of Mallows or Mercury, you may without any hurt handle ſcalding lead, ſo you do it with a ſpeedy motion. And yet there is nothing in the world that burns more then melted lead or boyling oyle; ſo that if you put a Tin or lead ſpoon into ſcalding oyle or melted lead, it will preſently melt, which you ſhall never be able to do in the moſt boyling water. For oyle and all fat things become moſt hot, and are extreamly inflamed, ſo that lead will ſoon melt and run being mingled with fat: whereas water hinders that the heat cannot penetrate into the lead, and therefore it is that the Eels roſted on a Gridiron, will burn a mans fingers vehemently, if you do not take heed when you turn then: for the fat will ſtick to your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ulcerate the skin, and raiſe bliſters with the heat. But ſince there are four things that contend for gravity and levity,<note place="margin">The four lighteſt liquors.</note> namely, Wine, Water, Honey, and Oyle. The lighteſt of all theſe and that weighs leaſt, is ſpirit of Wine, that being mingled with Oyle will flote on the top, and ſwim above the Oyle: for all terrene matter is taken from it by concoction, and all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it is fire and Ayre.</p>
                  <p>Next to this in lightneſſe is the Oyl preſſed forth of Linſeed and Seſame, which never, contrary to the nature of other Oyles,<note place="margin">Oyle of Linſeed and Seſama will not freeze.</note> grows hard with cold, by reaſon of its ſoftneſſe and inward heat.</p>
                  <p>Next to this is the liquor diſtill'd from green hearbs by force of the fire, and cleanſed Wine that hath no ſweetneſſe mingled with it. For that Forreign Wine, which they call baſtard, and we call <hi>Serope</hi> or <hi>Zerape,</hi> is heavier than all liquors, ſo that veſſels fill'd with that liquor will ſink in the water. Dew of Heaven, if it be not troubled, is of the ſame weight with Wine, namely that which falls from the Ayre in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and is kept ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years. But honey is a third part heavier than they.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore there is no liquor, that is uſed any ways for mans body that is lighter or more penetrating than Aquavitae, as it is called, becauſe it ſuſtains mans life, and retards old age, or that better preſerves all things from putrefaction and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The uſe whereof is grown ſo common amongſt the Dutch, that they drink more of it than is good for their health;<note place="margin">Aquavitae who it is good for.</note> For the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is not healthfull for all people, and at all times; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for ſuch as are lean and dry of nature. Again, in Summer the uſe of it is moſt pernicious; for it burns their bodies, and feeds on the natural moyſture. But for fat bodies and moiſt, and ſuch as are full of flegmatique humours, it doth them no hurt.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53844:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>For it concocts the excrementall humours, and it defends their bodies from Lethargies, Apoplexies, and all cold diſeaſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Winter I grant they may uſe it moderately, that is a dram and half, which is a ſpoonfull very well ſweetned with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and a piece of white bread put into it that it may not penetrate and fly up to the Noſtrills and the Brain, or hurt the Liver with its piercing heat. But being uſed outwardly to the Nerves and Muſcles, and to parts chil'd with cold, it will help them, and by its heating, and quick penetrating qualities, reſtrains and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſes all painfull effects that conſiſt in cold humours. Alſo it reſtores ſpeech to Apoplectick people, if you mingle with it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Rocket ſeed and ſome Vinegar of ſquills. And if that kind of wine be put into a Still, and drawn off twice or thrice with the fire, it will have an increadible piercing force.</p>

Firſt Gold, then Silver, then all kind of baſer mettals, as Tin, Lead, Braſſe, Copper, Iron, and all theſe with their principles hold affinity and agreement. For they will all melt in the fire, and may be made ductile for any work.</p>
                  <p>But for Quickſilver, that is that watry and running ſilver, what quality and force it hath, and whether it be cold or hot, Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot agree. Some ſay it is cold and moiſt, becauſe if you touch it, it will feel exceeding cold, and will aſtoniſh them, and cauſe the Palſie: others ſay it is hot and dry from the effect, becauſe they ſee the penetratious nature it is of, for if you open a vein of thoſe that have been once or twice anointed with it, for the Pox, the Quickſilver hath been ſeen ſometimes to come forth; which I think proceeds not from any imbred natural heat of it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is extinguiſhed with ſome burning materials or elſe mingled, whereby the cold and moiſt quality of it is blunted and made dull, and a fiery quality comes in the place of them. For there is a kind of powder that Mountebank, Chirurgions uſe, call'd praecipitate,<note place="margin">Powder praci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate.</note> becauſe it performs its operation ſuddenly and haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not without very grievous inconvenience of the body, for by the mixture of Vitriol, Salt-peter, and Allum, it acquires a fiery cauſtick quality by this way of preparation. But ſince this Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver colour'd liquid ſubſtance diſſipated and pul'd aſſunder, will come together again as it was, and run on heaps, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53844:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>handle it, or frame it, or mingle it with any medicaments, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the motion of it be hindred, the Induſtry and reaſon of man hath thought on ſome wayes how to do that, and to ſtop the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt which the ſafeſt and with leaſt danger is, to do it with mans ſpittle, to which there is mixt a little aſhes or powder of cuttle-bone. Now a cuttle is a ſea-cat, whoſe white crumbly bone the Gold-ſmiths uſe, the fleſh is ſtirring,<note place="margin">A Sea-cat.</note> and the blood ſerves for Ink. But this is worthy admiration, that ſince all things that are dug out of the earth, though never ſo heavy will ſwim up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this mettall, as Steel, Iron, Lead, and all ſorts of Braſſe, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gold ſinks below it, and is ſwallowed in, and becomes ſilver colour'd, that can be got off onely by fire, for ſo it evaporates into fumes into the Ayre, with a moſt filthy ſmell, not without great hurt to the ſtanders by, for it will cauſe their limbs to be aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and will ſoften their nerves: as we commonly ſee in ſuch as are buſied in guilding Silver veſſels, for Silver cannot be guilded with gold, but with the help of Quicſilver, for by that alone it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes tractible and obedient, for it refuſeth all other mettals and is affected with none but Gold, and will mingle with it, and be framed by it. So I have oft tried that on a pound and half of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver,<note place="margin">Nothing is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without Quickſilver.</note> two pound of Lead would ſwim, but a penny weight or ſcruple of Gold which is but the third part of a dram would ſink to the bottom. But of all mettals it is worſt to ſtick to Silver, bad to lead, very hardly to Iron, and ſomewhat difficult to ſtick to Braſſe. Melted lead in ſome reſpects is like to this Silver colour'd liquid ſubſtance. For all things will ſwim on the top thereof, Iron, flints, Potſheards, and many other things that will not melt in the fire, and will naturally run; for ſince nothing is more hot than melted Lead, Gold, Silver, Tin, will ſwim on the top thereof, but they preſently melt and run like wax. Alſo it is like Quickſilver for this, that being powred forth on a plain table, and the drops of it ſprinkled here and there, it doth not make it moyſt, and ſlippery, nor doth it ſtick to the Tables but with increadible ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unſtable motion it comes together again, and the drops run upon heaps with themſelves, becauſe they are of a condenſed matter, compact and ſolid and continued, and ſo condenſed that it will admit of no Ayre. Whence it hapneth, that not onely by reaſon of its weight it deſcends to the bottom, but becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no aereal ſubſtance in it.

What kind of Salt is the beſt.</note>NO man but knows the great uſe and neceſſity we have of Salt. For beſides that, that Salt makes all meats ſavoury, and moſt pleaſant to our taſt and Pallats, and procures an appetite to our meat, it preſerves all things from corruption, eſpecially that which is boyld, till all the muddy dreggs be taken from it: for it will ſhine of a bright colour, and all things may be ſafely ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith, and kept all the Summer; for it will drink up and conſume all excrementitious humours, and thickneth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſeth all fleſh and fiſh, that the ambient aire cannot make them putrify.<note place="margin">Salt makes fruitfull.</note> Yet all men muſt needs wonder that Salt ſhould cauſe fruitfullneſſe, and cure barrennes: and that ſome fields have been made fruitfull by Salt ſtrewed upon them, which experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath proved to be true. For far women that are commonly barren, become fruitfull and fit to conceive by eating Salt mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately with their meats, for it wipes away all foule moyſture, and dries the overwet matrix, and cauſeth the genitall ſeed to ſtick more eaſily to the womb that is not ſo ſlippery as before: But to dry women, whoſe matrix is ſcorched, like to ground that is thirſty, moyſtning things muſt be given, for Salt and ſharp things are naught for them. Alſo the Low-Countries ſhew that it will provoke the reines, and cauſe erection, who uſing Salt meats much, are exceeding ſalacious. So the frequent eating of Sea fiſh, and all ſhell fiſh, as Oyſters, Crabs, Lobſters, Cockels, Periwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, make people luſtfull, and are of a hot biting nature. For which cauſe the Aegptians,<note place="margin">Sin ſympoſ.</note> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, abſtained from Salt, and all Salt meats, becauſe they were perſwaded that Salt cauſed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery. Wherefore they though fit rather to eate unſavoury meats, than to uſe the moſt ſavoury ſawce, but I think they were too ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious in obſerving that, nor did they ſufficiently take care of their health: for Salt drives away corruption from mans body, and conſumes all ſtrange and accidentall humours. Add to this that it hath an imbred force for generation of Children, whereby the conjugall covenant is confirmed. For the moderate uſe of it raiſeth the vigour of the mind, and not only for embracing and kiſſing, but for all actions we take in hand, it will make us more cheerfull and ready. But that it helps fruitfullneſſe, it is proved becauſe a wonderfull number of Rats and Mice are bred in Ships at Sea, and that women that deal in Salt are alwaies itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and have many Children: who are commonly helped by Sea-men and Fiſher-men that come into the Havens,<note place="margin">Salt makes field and Mares fruitfull.</note> and theſe are luſty fellows to do their buſineſſe.

                  <p>But if Towns and Forts beſieged ſtraightly ſhould ſtand in need of this, they muſt make Salt of Sea-water,<note place="margin">Salt-water.</note> which you ſhall find then to be effectuall, when the Salt liquor will bear an Egg or Ambergreece. Next to this, to preſerve meats, is Vineger, but it will not laſt ſo long, for unleſſe after ſome months you poure off the former, and poure on freſh Vineger, on the ſeaſon'd meats,<note place="margin">The force of Vineger.</note> they will be mouldy and finnoed. But what force and faculty it hath, as by many things, ſo alſo it may be tried by this, that an egge ſteeped three dayes in Vinegar, that is very ſharp, or a little more, the ſhell will grow ſo tender, that you may draw it through a ring like a thin membrane.<note place="margin">Vineger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes an egge and diſſolves a Whet-ſtone.</note> Alſo a Whet-ſtone or a Flint ſteeped 7 dayes in Vinegar, may be crumbled with your finger into powder.

By the ſame reaſon it reſiſts Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomes, and drives away the Contagion of Peſtilent diſeaſes: Therefore me-thinks, they do well who, when any publick diſeaſe is ſpread in a Country, do moderately uſe Vineger: For this will diſperſe and ſcatter the faulty Ayre, and if you eate any of it will keep the humours from infection and corruption. So thoſe that ſuck out venome with their mouths, and any ſtinking wounds, do waſh their mouths with ſharp Vineger. But great care muſt be taken that we do not uſe Vineger too much and immoderately; for it dryes the brain, and hinders ſleep, wherefore I Counſell you to mingle ſome Roſe-water with it, and a little Rheniſh-wine, and Saffron a ſmal quantity. For ſo it will do the head leſſe hurt.

                  <p>THe principall way of preſerving a mans health, conſiſts in his temperance and moderation in eating and drinking. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſpoken elſewhere abundantly, of eating dry food and of bread, I ſhall here ſpeak of drink, and in what manner and meaſure it ought to be uſed. Firſt it cannot be preſcribed certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and abſolutely to thoſe that are in Health.

The beſt and ſafeſt way of drinking is to be judged of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the age of people, and difference of times, as alſo the cuſtomes they have long uſed, and as their ſtrength is, and as the Wine is ſtrong or weak. So Beere or Wine, or other drink muſt be preſcribed to quench a mans thirſt, and that the meat may not be dry nor flote, but be moderately wet. Wherefore the body muſt be refreſhed by times, and at moderate diſtances, and the meat muſt be now and then ſteeped with moiſture, that it may the more commodiouſly goe into the veins by concoction, and be digeſted into the body. But all drunkenneſſe,<note place="margin">

                     </note> eſpecially continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, is pernicious, becauſe the nerves being ſoked continually with much Wine, are ſoftned, and the whole frame of the body is diſſolved. Wherefore a man ought to drink moderately all drinks that cauſe drunkenneſſe, and in that we ought to imitate all Fiſhmongers and Butchers,<note place="margin">A ſimile from Butchers.</note> who when they ſtore up their fiſh or fleſh cut into peices they poure in brine upon every row as they lay it, and ſeaſon it with Salt in order. So we, if we will take care of our health, muſt water our meat in order as we eate it, by drinking moderately.<note place="margin">When digeſtion begins we muſt not drink.</note> But it is hurtfull to tire the ſtomach with drink when concoction is begun, for it hinders and ſtops the faculties and functions of Nature, that ſhe is about, and will not let the meat boil and concoct.<note place="margin">A ſimile from the Kitchin.</note> For as pots leave off boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cool by powring in cold water: So the ſtomach hindred by drink powred in, ceaſeth to digeſt what it hath begun, and is lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger about it, nor doth it concoct it ſo well; for ſo the meat is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the narrow veins undigeſted, or into the capacity of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53844:86"/>bowels before its due time. Whereby the uſe and fruit that a man ſhould have of his meat is loſt, and by obſtructing the bowels cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth putrefaction of humours, and becomes the ſeminary of Feavers and other diſeaſes; And the ſame Inconvenience befalls them, who before meat when they go to meals, drink abundantly. For the meats are preſently waſhed away, and cannot ſtay long in the ſtomach.<note place="margin">We muſt drink by degrees and not greedily.</note> Wherefore I think it is good counſell for people not to drink greedily and great draughts when they eat, but by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, that ſo both may mingle as they ſhould, and be concected alike, eſpecially thoſe that have large paſſages, and wide veins.

For ſo it will moiſten the ſtomach very abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, nor doth the drink preſently run away to the bladder. For a little drink neither quencheth thirſt, nor abates the heat, but augments it the more;<note place="margin">A ſimile from a Smiths ſhop.</note> For as Sea-coles in Smiths forges wetted with wet bruſhes, ſometimes will flame and burn the more, ſo the heat of a Feaver is kindled the more, and not quenched with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle drink and makes the ſick the more thirſty.

For ſo the liquor will ſtay the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and moiſten all the dry parts.<note place="margin">It is ſometimes better to eat than to drink.</note> But I thought fit to joyn to this argument ſuch as conſume by a hectick Feaver or conſumption, and are grown exceeding lean by diſeaſes, it is better for them to eat ſome ſolid meat, than to drink any drink. For the weight of the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For ſince the parts and paſſages of the throat deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this uſe are ſunk down, that the ſides lye one upon the other, drink being thin and not weighty cannot open them eaſily and paſſe down inoffenſively, unleſſe they drink abundantly: for ſo the throat will give away, and the drink run down. The like to this befalls thoſe that have the Palſy,<note place="margin">The ſpirits can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo well paſſe to the nerves as the meat.</note> or the Apoplex. For the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being thin and ſubtile do not eaſily paſſe from the brain to the nerves.

                  <p>NOt onely faulty and virulent humours breed from corrupt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triments of the body; but beſides ſome ſorts of Worms, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of living creatures breed in the ſecret cavities of the bowels.<note place="margin">The beginning of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> For it hath been obſerved in our dayes, that a certain woman being diſſected, ſome beaſts were taken out like to rats and mice, that it ſeems were bred from ſome foul excrements that came from the food ſhe are. For natural heat being buſied in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting that matter, could make no other ſhape of it, than ſuch as the matter would bear it had to work upon: wherefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward force of nature frameth a living creature of that kind, and endeavours it; that moiſt ſubſtance being fit and ready to obey the efficient cauſe. For it is found by experience that houſe-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as whelps, cats, mice, rats, flitter-mice, toads, and frogs, when they wander up and down in Cellars and Butteries, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leave upon meats an excremental ſeed,<note place="margin">Creatures bred of filth.</note> which when men do not waſh clean from filth, or do not wipe clean the outſides of fruits or pare them, from that moiſt foul matter that pollutes the meats, ſome ſuch things are bred. And if ſnails and mice breed from corruption, and beetles, drones, and waſps from dung, and from dew, and moiſt Aire, caterpillars, butterflies, ants, locuſts, graſhoppers; who can think it ſtrange that in the bodies of men from ſuch like cauſes ſuch things ſhould be bred? Since here is a more effectuall reaſon, that yeilds a ſeminary cauſe for this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For thoſe breed of corruption and not from ſeed, though it be anſwerable thereto for force and vigour, and next kind in facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But thoſe things that are bred alive in the ſecret parts of mans body,<note place="margin">Animals bred of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord from no ſeed.</note> proceed from a vitall humour and a living Creature. Therefore this muſt not ſeem againſt reaſon or a Paradox of ſome old women, when as we ſee ſo many things bred ſpontaneouſly, without any copulation or incubation of living creatures, and that from a humour enlivened by the heat of the outward Ayre. For beſides thoſe creatures that are bred on the wide earth, what an infinite number of fiſh are thus produced in the vaſt Seas and waters for mans uſe and commodity? For there is nothing more fruitfull than the Sea;<note place="margin">Why the ſea is fruitfulll with fiſh.</note> becauſe the ſubſtance of it is groſſe, and is full of a vitall heat in all parts. In which, as many things are bred from ſeed; ſo a great many, of themſelves without ſeed or help of any living creature.</p>
                  <p>So all Shell-Fiſh are firſt bred from ſome muddy and ſlimy moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and all glib fiſh, as Eels in ſpeciall, which afterwards by copulation breed whole ſholes.<note place="margin">Spearing or Groundlins.</note> Groundlins, very ſmall fiſh in

                     <hi>Holland</hi> are bred abundantly from the froth of the Sea, when after long drouth, rain falls in great quantity.

Since therefore Nature attempts many ſtrange things, whoſe force by the guift of God is ſpread every where: let no man think it an old Wives dream, that ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Creatures are framed in mens bodies, ſince in corrupt rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wood, and many dead things, Teredines and many nimble Worms are bred, as we ſee them in Cheeſe, and many other meats in Summer ſeaſon, where Wormes breed in abundance. Add to this, that from filthy Ulcers and Impoſtumes, pieces of Nails, Hair, Shels, Bones, Stones, are taken forth, that grew from the concretion of putrid humours,<note place="margin">Impoſtums ſend forth rubbiſh and hair.</note> and I have known Worms with tails, and little Creatures of ſtrange forms caſt up by vomit, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from ſuch as were ſick of contagious diſeaſes, in whoſe Urines I have often ſeen ſmall Creatures to ſwim, like to Ants, or eſpecially like to thoſe that in Summer uſe to role in the dew,<note place="margin">Goat-worms in Summer bred in dew.</note> and none of theſe perſons, but was foully peppered with the <hi>French Pox.</hi> The intent therefore of this diſcourſe is to this purpoſe, that no man ſhould without care cram in foul meats, and not well waſh'd and cleanſed from outward accidents, which when Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people neglect, they uſe to be ſcabby and full of Puſhes that itch, and to be deformed with many fores and vices of their skins. For they are not of ſo good habit of body, and ſound conſtitution, nor ſo comely and ingenious, and of ſuch excellent naturall parts, nor yet ſo healthfull, generally, as ſome Noble men and Gentlemen are, that will ſuffer no meat to come to their Tables, no not the pureſt White-bread, untill the outſide and cruſt of it be finely chipt off, and the reſt of their proviſion muſt be curiouſly and accurately provided with all decency and cleanlineſſe.<note place="margin">Cleanlineſſe in diet is joyn'd to health.</note> And this I find no fault with, ſo long as all is done, farr from luxury, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally and temperately in reſpect of diet.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53844:89"/>eſpecially ſhe ſhews her forces upon earthly things, when ſhe is full, the Sun being right over againſt her, and makes her round, or when ſhe is in Conjunction with him, for at theſe times Corn grows and augments, ſhell-fiſh ſwell, the veines are full of blood and the bones full of marrow; whence it is that copulation at thoſe times offends leaſt. And becauſe ſhe moiſteneth all things, fleſh that are ſubjected and expoſed to the Moon-beames corrupt, and men that are drunk &amp; dead aſleep allmoſt, Wax pale, and are troubled with the Head-ache, and are affected with <hi>Epilepſie:</hi> for it looſeneth the Nerves,<note place="margin">She cauſeth the ebbing and flowing of the Sea.</note> and moiſteneth the brain over-much, and by its chilling force, it ſtupefies the mind. Alſo no man may doubt but that ſhe is the cauſe of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea. For being that we fee, that when the Moon is dark and ſilent, or a halfe Moon, or crooked with Horns, or increaſeth or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the waters do not run much together, nor are there any high tides,<note place="margin">The Moon moves the Sea</note> upon any ſhores whatſoever: but again when ſhe is in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Sun, and begins to be a new Moon, or to be round and a full Moon, the tides are very great, and the waves riſe exceedingly: who then can aſcribe the flowing and ebbing of the Sea to any thing than to the motion of the Moon? For as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone draws Iron,<note place="margin">A ſimile from the Load-ſtones forces.</note> ſo this Planet being next the earth, moves and draws the Sea. For when the Moon riſeth, the Sea roules about thoſe parts, namely the Eaſtern parts, and leaves the Weſtern parts: but when ſhe goes to the Weſt and ſets, the flouds increaſe in thoſe parts, and abate in the Eaſtern parts; and this more abundantly or ſparingly, as the Moon increaſeth or decreaſeth in her light, that is conveighed by the Moon-beams. And if any man pleaſe to conſider the Countries and places, and Coaſts thereof in the French Sea, and our Northern Sea, and what flood is made upon every ſhore there, he ſhall ſee as clear as the day, that all this is governed by the light of the-Moon. For where the Moon riſing illuminates divers Countries and Climates, and runs her courſe through the paſſage of the Heavens, the flood and lifting up of the Sea, is carried directly thither, whither the Moons beams are directed, and to ſuch parts of the earth, and ſhores, ſhe moſt then reſpects, as being over againſt her.

Of which things I ſhall give ſome inſtances, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome examples, of place, Cities and Coaſts that the Sea waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Before all theſe things can be perfectly underſtood, I thought fit to lay down this maxime: that the Moon, if ſhe increaſe, hath her horns turn'd from the Sun, looking toward the Eaſt: if ſhe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53844:89"/>decreaſe toward the Weſt, which ſtaying oft-times three dayes in conjunction, at length ſhines again, and is ſeen with horns. But every day as ſhe increaſeth, ſhe removes farther from the Sun, and augmenting untill the ſeventh day ſhe appears a half Moon; and that part of her is enlightned that is oppoſed to the Sun going to the Weſt; and that part of the Moon that looks toward the Eaſt is dark; for the Moon increaſing allwaies followes the Sun-ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and is ſeen above our Horizon. But when ſhe decreaſeth ſhe goes before the Sun, and riſeth before him and is ſeen in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning above the Horizon, being allwaies enlightned on that part which regards the Sun: whereby it comes to paſſe, that the croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and horny part is allwaies turned away from the Sun, but the round and bunchy part is againſt the Sun and turn'd toward it. But on the fourteenth day when ſhe is diametrically oppoſite to the Sun, ſhe is at full, and ſhe riſeth as the Sun ſets in the Weſt. Whence it comes to paſſe that ſhee is totally enlightned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Suns light every way. On the ſeventeenth day when the Sun riſeth, the Moon ſets in the Weſt, but on the one and twentieth day, when the Sun riſeth the Moon is almoſt paſt the middle of the heavens, and that part that looks toward the Sun is light, and all the other parts are dark. Then as ſhe perfects her courſe every day, in the twenty eighth day, and the third part of a day, that is eight hours, ſhe finiſheth her whole courſe through the Zodiack: and as the Sun makes the year, ſo the Moon makes a Moneth, changing ſomewhat every week: for both thoſe times; namely after he firſt apparition that ſhe increaſeth to be a half Moon, and from thence become round and to be a full Moon, are finiſhed by feven dayes, that is for both times fourteen dayes. Likewiſe from that time when ſhe becomes a half Moon again, if you reckon the ſame way, by the ſame proportion, and ſo from thence till ſhe is quite taken from our ſight and is in conjunction with the Sun, you ſhall find ſeven dayes. Wherefore it is clear that the Moon changeth the month,<note place="margin">The Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries call a Month from the Moon.</note> which force ſhe receives by the Suns aſpect, and hath of her ſelf no force or power. But when ſhe comes to joyn with the Sun, or to be in oppoſition with him and in the full, then are there very great changes made both by Sea and Land: for it is proved, becauſe then ſhe raiſeth boyſterous winds, and great tides that flow up to the ſhores.</p>

                     <note place="margin">When the Moon raiſeth tempeſts.</note>It is obſerved in our memory in a very few years, that the Sea hath mightily overflow'd the Low-Countries four times, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably waſted the Land, breaking down all the banks and mounds, and that in the winter time, when the moon hath greater force to raiſe tides and cauſe tempeſts than in Summer ſeaſon, yet ſo that the flood and overflowing of the waters ever fell upon a new or full Moon.<note place="margin">Inundations are moſt at begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Winter.</note> And thoſe Countries and climates ſuffered moſt harm that were next to the Moons aſpect and influence: but when the Moons courſe tended to other coaſts then they were more ſubject to inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and violence of the waters. Hence it is that in <hi>Flanders</hi> they firſt feel the inconvenience of great floods, and are in danger
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53844:90"/>by them, next to them the <hi>Mattiaci,</hi> that live in the Iſlands of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> next to them thoſe of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and ſometimes theſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe ports and good harbours for ſhips to ride in, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammaged by the force of the waters, as the Moon moves to one country or to another.<note place="margin">North-Weſt.</note> Alſo Weſt and North-weſt winds exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the rage of the Sea, that from the Sun-ſetting do violently blow upon the earth; and drive the waves of the Sea far and wide into the continent, yet ſo that the billows are forced ſometimes to one part, and ſometimes to another part of the earth, and every country takes its turn, as the diſtance of the places are, and the Sea flows up to them ſooner or later for the ſame cauſe. And that every man may perfectly underſtand this, I will ſpeak more at large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.<note place="margin">The Eaſt is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Weſt.</note> The day that the new Moon appears, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies toward the Weſt, becauſe the Sun inclines that way, by whoſe light ſhe begins to ſhine, and whereby ſhe comes to be full, we ſee that the ſame day the flouds begin to riſe and flow forth, and the next ports are fill'd to a certain height, and thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they are carried to all places in the way Eaſtward, ſo that the daies following, the ſea moves one hour later than it did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moon is daily removed farther from it, and carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the South, and the Eaſt departs farther from the Sun. For example, <hi>Calis</hi>-rode, and the <hi>Sluce</hi> that is ſcituate in the confines of <hi>Flanders,</hi> being a ſmall City there, near to <hi>Bruges,</hi> a new and full Moon makes full water at them both, about eleven of the clock when ſhe is light on that ſide, which is bent back toward the South. But at <hi>Arnemuſe</hi> and <hi>Middlebourgh,</hi> at two of the clock be it night or day; at <hi>Zirick</hi>-Sea, at three of the Clock, the Moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned toward the Weſt in Winter,<note place="margin">South-Weſt.</note> when the South-Weſt wind blows, and the Sun is in Capricorn: at <hi>Berg</hi> an hour and half or two hours later; at <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Dort,</hi> when the Moon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to the Equinoctial Weſtward, when the Weſt-winds blow gently about ſix of the Clock: at <hi>Mechlin</hi> about eight of the clock, yet ſo that the Sea flows in ſometimes ſooner, ſometimes later, when the weather is calm, or the wind blows ſtrongly. And when in the ſpace of ſix hours ſhe moves toward the Weſt, ſhe cauſeth the Sea to ebb and ſink down as many hours, untill the Moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone out of our ſight riſeth to thoſe that are Antipodes to us: for then the Sea flowes again: but when the Moon comes to mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night and comes to our hemiſphere, the flouds fall back again. Wherefore the ſcituation of places muſt be obſerved, and to what part of the heavens they are inclined, and the coaſts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries muſt be regarded, and we muſt fit the courſe of the Moon riſing and ſetting thereunto. For thus it will be eaſy to know the ebbing and flowing of the water at all places. But let no man think the horns of the Moon are to be taken notice of, for on that ſide it hath no operation, but we muſt regard the bunchy and convex part of it which is enlightned by the Sun.<note place="margin">The aſpects of the Moon cauſe the floud in all places.</note> For that part of the Moon that is againſt the Sun and toward the earth draws the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fills thoſe Ports and Havens with a flowing water which
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53844:90"/>ſhe directly reſpects with her beams. For the Sea runs that way the light of the Moon drives them. Yet let them that are Sailers take notice of this, that when the Moon riſeth and ſhews her ſelf firſt in our hemiſphere, if the part of the Moon that is enlightned by the Sun, ſend her beams Eaſtward, that in thoſe parts that are Eaſtward the waters have riſen to their height; again if the Moon look Southward or Weſtward, in thoſe places the flouds riſe, and fall in the Eaſtern parts. Wherefore if any man ſail from the Eaſt, or Winter aequinoctial from whence the South-Eaſt, or Eaſt winds blow, toward the Weſt countries; it will be the time to ſail forth at high water when the flouds are greateſt, to paſſe into the Lower-Countries. As for example: From <hi>Mechlin, Antwerp, Dort, Berg, Breda, Bolduc, Delph, Gand,</hi> and other places that are ſcituate farther off, it is good to ſet forth when it is full Sea, and the waters begin to fall. Again if any man ſail from the Weſt Southward or Eaſtward, he muſt ſet forth and Sail into the deep at low-water, when the Sea is comming in, and the flouds begin to come back; So that he muſt alwaies take notice of the Moons motion, and to what part of the Heaven ſhe enclines, and what Coaſts and Ports ſhe reſpects.</p>

For it hath in it a venemous quality, and ſecret poiſon, that it contracts from the foulneſſe of the teeth in part, and partly from vitious humours. For to the mouth and Jaws fumes riſe from theſe and infect the ſpittle with a contrary quality. Whence it is that ſometimes we perceive a ſalt, ſowre, ſweet,<note place="margin">Sweat and ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle have their forces from the humours.</note> or ſharp taſte in our ſpittle, as there is in ſweat alſo.

                  <p>Hence it is that thoſe whoſe ſtomachs abound with flegme, are alwaies full of ſpittle in their mouths, and is overwet with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate moiſture: but ſuch as are hot about the entrals and dry with a feavorous heat, their tongues are not wet at all,<note place="margin">Who have a dry or moiſt mouth.</note> but crack as the earth doth, when it is over-dried and parched by the heat of the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore the qualities and effects of Spittle come from the humours (for out of them is it drawn by the faculty of nature as fire draws diſtilled water from hearbs) the reaſon may be eaſily underſtood,<note place="margin">A ſimile from diſtilled hearbs.</note> why ſpittle ſhould do ſuch ſtrange things, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſome creatures.

They alſo that ride much, or
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53844:92"/>lye along on Ship-boards, and lye hard on their backs, are very Prone and given much to Venery. For the Nerves deſtinated for mans generation that run to the genitall parts grow hot: ſo that by the agitation and influence of humours, the loines are provoked; and there is erection made thereby. By the ſame reaſon, if any man hurt or bruiſe his great Toe of his foot, immediately from this effect the groin and cods ſwell, that is, that wrinkled cover of the Teſticles is in pain by it, ariſing from conſent; and by reaſon of the interweaving of Nervs and Veins. As if any man puts into a fire that is very hot, a pair of Tongues, or other iron,<note place="margin">A ſimile from Smiths.</note> not only the part put into the fire will be red hot, but alſo that part which is farr from the fire, grows ſo hot that it cannot be handled: ſo pain is communicated to the parts that are on the ſame ſide, and the ſickly affect is conveighed to the neighbouring part. So from the Stomach, Inteſtins, Matrix, Spleen, Liver, the head is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when the brain is hurt or troubled with any diſtemper, the miſchiefe is derived from thence to the parts that are under it. And therefore Mid-wives, though they know not the cauſe of it,<note place="margin">The generative parts are ſigns of good health or ſickneſſe.</note> uſe to ſearch and ſee the Teſticles of Children, when they are ſick, and their privy member, by the obſervation whereof, they can judge: young men alſo, may perceive certain ſignes of recovery of death, of health or ſickneſſe.

But if theſe ſecret parts be wrinkled and raiſed up, and the yard ſtands ſtiffe, it is a ſigne all will be well. But that the event may exactly anſwer the praediction, we muſt mark in what part of the body the diſeaſe lyeth. For if in diſeaſes of the brain, and ſuch as are above the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> and the Septum Tranſverſum, the generative parts hang down and flag, it is healthfull, as on the contrary it is an ill ſign to have them drawn upward; for the vitall faculty dies, and the nerves are contracted to their firſt original.</p>

But Prieſts and Monks becauſe they are given to ſleep and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and never uſe exerciſe or to labour, can very hardly reſiſt theſe diſeaſes.

So it is obſerved that that kind of drink the people call ſpruſe Beer, at a certain time of the year will grow ſowre, and afterwards ſtrangely come to its former vigour: the ſame happens in that outlandiſh wine called Baſtard, and black Spaniſh-wine, that ſtains ones hands and napkins, and makes all linnen of a deep red colour, as the Actian Cherries do, which we commonly call <hi>Morellen.</hi>

But oyling and annointing, though they are out of uſe almoſt with moſt Nations, and the cuſtome is loſt, yet is it healthfull for the bodies of both young and old people, for they will condenſe bodies that the outward ayr and winds cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into them, or elſe they ſerve to looſen them, that they may not be ſmothered by fumes within.

Alſo Aquafortis that the Gold-ſmiths part Gold from Silver with, is as bad. Though ſome of our Matrons are not afraid to make their locks yellow with it; with great hurt to, and ſometimes the loſſe of their hair, for the roots of their hair thus dried wither, and they become bald and ugly, without all hopes of their hair growing again: And if you put this into a rotten tooth it will eat the gums.</p>

                  <p>For being that he was the common Parent of all mankind, and from him the nature of man being traduced, was thereby vitiated this guilt and corruption and depravation of nature was ſpread by propagation into all his poſterity, as it falls out with them that are born of ſickly Parents from faulty humours and corrupt ſeed,<note place="margin">An example from a corrupt body.</note> an hereditary diſeaſe will ſtick to theſe children ſo long as they live.

                  <p>Likewiſe ſome dye ſuddenly before their time, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for the Childrens cauſe indulge unto themſelves overmuch: and do nothing but gripe and plot for wealth, poſſeſſions honours, dignities, and lofty titles: and they make their way unto them by right and wrong, and without any firm truſt in God, do all they can to mount to high preferments; whereas God oft-times ſoon takes their children from this life,<note place="margin">Whence comes death before the time.</note> and will not let them live long, and the empty hopes of the Parents periſh. Which is confirmed by that ſaying of the Wiſe man: <hi>He pleaſed God and was beloved of him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Wiſdome</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo that living amongſt ſinners he was tranſlated, yea ſpeedily was he taken away, leſt that wickedneſſe ſhould alter his underſtanding, or deceit beguil his ſoul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">It is from God that Parents are deprived of children.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore haſted he to take him away from the midſt of the wicked. And when men ſee this, ſaith he, they underſtand not the cauſe of it, nor can they tell why they dye ſo ſoon, and come ſo ſuddenly to an end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ſometimes it falls out by the providence of God, that the heir dieth, and all hopes of poſterity and the very pillar of the family falls. Alſo <hi>Hoſeas</hi> profeſſeth that God takes away ſome mens children for their Parents wickedneſſe.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</note> For ſo God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth wicked men there. <hi>Their glory ſhall flye away like a Bird, from the birth and from the Womb and from the conception:</hi> that is, they ſhall be barren and unfruitfull,<note place="margin">Barrenneſſe and want of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from God.</note> nor ſhall they beget or conceive any children, and if they get any I will ſlay them, and take them away from the earth. There are in all ages innumerable examples of this matter: For we ſee the chief Nobility and Lords in Court not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to want and be deprived of their children, but to run in debt exceedingly. But that <hi>David</hi> was deprived of the child he had by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53844:100"/>
                     <hi>ſheba</hi> the wife of <hi>Uriah,</hi> there was great reaſon for it in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 12.</note> For a grievous revenge from God followed that Tragedy and wickedneſſe committed, Gods anger being kindled both againſt <hi>David</hi> and the child. For God ſtroke the child with an incurable ſickneſſe, that it died on the ſeventh day, as it uſeth to be in very acute diſeaſes. For the provident juſtice of God would have none remain that was ſo begotten: though <hi>David</hi> as the Scripture relates, fell down upon the ground, and wept and prayed continually that God would have mercy on the child. This Hiſtory affords every man a wholeſome leſſon, that ſo far as mans frailty will permit, he ſhould keep himſelf from all diſhoneſty,<note place="margin">Adultery to be avoided.</note> and eſpecially from embracing thoſe that are lawfully married accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods inſtitution to other men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">We muſt not grieve too much for loſſe of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note>And again if God take away a mans children he ought not to vex, toil, and perplex himſelf, and deſtroy or hurt himſelf with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate ſorrow: For what a madneſſe is it to afflict a mans ſelf for thoſe things that cannot be reſtored, or poſſibly live again? Wherefore <hi>Davids</hi> courage deſerves praiſe, &amp; his great moderation of his paſſions in ſo ſad a condition. For as ſoon the child was dead, whereas a little before he was in a very ſad caſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>David</hi> was not ſorrowfull for the child's death.</note> lying in duſt and aſhes, as the cuſtome of that country is, &amp; could poſſibly lament no more than he did; he preſently ſhook off all ſorrow, and ſat down to eat in his Kingly majeſty. But as for the other part of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy which had as lamentable an end as the former: God offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>David's</hi> wickedneſſe, denounceth terrible threats againſt him by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet,<note place="margin">Adultery not unpuniſhed. <hi>2</hi> Kings <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> for that having raviſhed ſo chaſte a Matron, and killed ſo faithfull a Captain <hi>Uriah,</hi> he had given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the Enemies of God to blaſpheme, and not onely to inſult over Gods people, but to revile and ſpeak hardly of God himſelf. But to paſſe to the other part of the Argument: It falls out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that children for the Parents faults undergo ſome marks and notes of Infamy and Ignominy, and ſome diſgrace comes unto them thereby. For example, if the Mother commit adultery,<note place="margin">When children are forced to carry their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faults.</note> if ſhe be a drunken ſot, or noted for any notorious crime, part of this diſgrace is derived to her children. So if any one be born by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, or unlawfull copulation, or by natural conjunction, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore marriage (whence by cuſtome ſuch children are called natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) the people will commonly ſcoff at ſuch children,<note place="margin">What children are natural.</note> and deride them, as the nature of mortal men is, to be raſh, petulant, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,<note place="margin">Mans reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</note> and injurious: but this reproach proceeds commonly from men of depraved manners and affections, ſince the children are in no fault. For the writers of the Goſpel were not aſhamed in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down our Saviours Genealogy, to reckon up many that were not lawfully begotten in the ſtate of Matrimony;<note place="margin">Homil. <hi>3.</hi> in Math.</note> which <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> thinks was done purpoſely, and ſo do many more, that no man might grow proud by the dignity of his progenitours, nor be dejected if he were born of mean Parents, or that were not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their vertues, ſo they themſelves endeavour and contend to do what is worthy to be commended: For every man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled

                  <p>THere are two external accidental things, that are no leſſe hurtfull than they are healthfull to our bodies. Which do ſupport our health, and ſometimes make us ſick:<note place="margin">The Ayre and winds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make us well, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſick.</note> namely nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Ayre that ſurrounds us, by the agitation and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, there ariſeth wind and blaſts, to which our bodies are expoſed every moment, and thereby ſuffer manifeſt changes. But winds and windy vapours breed in our bodies,<note place="margin">Whence come winds in the body.</note> partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the external beating of the Ayre, and partly from meats and drinks that being taken in, cauſe winds, and ſtretch the belly: as are Beans, Peaſon, raw hearbs, Rapes, Radiſhes, fruits of Trees, ſweet wine, new beer and Ale; and Winds riſing from theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſtomach, and are offenſive to the Inteſtines, and the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondres and Middriff.

But if they ſtay over long in the body, or faſten upon any part, they cauſe pains, and muſt be excluded by applying hot remedies outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and inwardly by ſuch things as diſpell winds: as Cummin,<note place="margin">What things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell winds.</note> Bay-berries, Anniſeed, Fennel-ſeed, Carway-ſeed; ſtrong Wines, as Malmſey and Candey Wine.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>But ſince outward winds are commonly offenſive to us, and by their penetrating force do us much hurt, I ſhall chiefly ſpeak of them here. For they ſometimes get ſecretly into our bodies, and ſometimes openly, and by violence they ruſh in, and do great hurt to men, heards of cattle, Corn, hearbs, Trees.<note place="margin">The original of winds.</note> The wind proceeds from the Ayre and ſmall blaſts moved and toſſed, whence it is, that ſometimes it is gentle, eaſy and pleaſant; ſometimes ſtrong, violent and vehement, as the Ayre is calm or moved.<note place="margin">What the wind is.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wind is nothing elſe, then an effuſion and flowing form of the forces of the Ayre troubled, which receives ſtrength and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment from the exhalations and vapours of the earth: Or as <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi> ſaith, The wind is the flowing ſourge of the Ayre, moved by uncertain and unſtable motion.<note place="margin">John <hi>3.</hi> A place of the Goſpel explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> Which when our Saviour ſpeaks of, he ſaith, The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth. For taking a ſimilitude from the outward blaſts, he inſtructs <hi>Nicodemus</hi> by what force and what ſecret operation the ſpirit of God affects the minds of men. For as the aereal blaſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53844:103"/>is not quiet nor obedient to any mans command, but is reſtleſſe and unquiet, and is carried by its own violence, and driven here and there: ſo that being diffuſed all over, it ſhews it ſelf by the effect and noiſe of it, and not by ſight; ſometimes wholeſome for the earth,<note place="margin">Gods ſpirit compared with the winds.</note> and ſometimes hurtfull: ſo the Spirit of God by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and unſpeakable blaſt beats upon the minds of men, drives, forces, inflames, ſtirs up, transforms, and makes ſpiritual of carnal men. But as the mind of man ſubſiſts and is ſupported by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; ſo this animal living body of ours is no leſſe refreſhed with the whole ſome outward Ayre, than with meat and drink. For the uſe of Ayre and breath that we draw into our bodies is as needfull for us as our nouriſhments, for without them mans nature can ſubſiſt a while,<note place="margin">Hunger when hurtful.</note> for ſome have pined away ſeven or nine dayes for hunger, but without the outward Ayre, and gentle blaſts, no man can ſubſiſt one moment but he would be ſtrangled. Now the purer and the leſſe contagious the Ayre is,<note place="margin">Ill Ayre worſe than ill dies.</note> the more wholeſome it is for the body. For if the Ayre be peſtilent and contagious, it is more hurtfull than venemous and faulty meats, for ſuch meats may be vomited up again or digeſted by the heat of the ſtomach: but peſtilent and contagious Ayre, cannot be eaſily conquered or altered, when it is once taken into the body; for it preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the heart and vitall ſpirits: Wherefore this common Ayre that ſerves us to live in, and by help whereof we draw out and put in our breath, muſt be carefully regarded. And no leſſe reſpect muſt be had in preſervation of our health, unto the winds that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and are diffuſed from the Ayre, and that not onely in regard to an open and free Ayre, that we are expoſed unto, but alſo in building of our Houſes,<note place="margin">Obſervation in making our dores.</note> Galleries, Porches, Windows, Dores, and all proſpects, by which the Winds without may enter into our Chambers and Dining-rooms, that we may be refreſhed with wholeſome blaſts, and great and unwholeſome winds may not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us.<note place="margin">

So in the Low-Countries near the Sea, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cities, and Towns are expoſed to the South and South-weſt, Men are ſick the greateſt part of the year, and ſubject to flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique defluxions.

Whereby it appears plainly that the unſtable moving of the winds
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53844:103"/>bring ſickneſſes to mens bodies, and makes them have their health worſe: which if we could avoid and ſhut out, every man would leſſe fall into diſeaſes; or if by any cauſe a man do fall ſick, if you bar out ill winds he will recover the ſooner.<note place="margin">Cardinal Winds are ſour.</note> The Antients becauſe there are four quarters of the world divided the winds into as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and <hi>Ovid</hi> elegantly deſcribed them.<note place="margin">Metam, L. <hi>1.</hi>

For not ſo much the bodies as the minds of men are changed by reaſon of the Ayre and winds.<note place="margin">The mind trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Ayre.</note> So that men in health are otherwiſe affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the Ayre is tempeſtuous and troubled, and otherwiſe when the weather is calm and the sky clear, otherwiſe when the Weſt-wind blows, otherwiſe when the South or South-weſt, that not onely mens bodies are more active, but their minds are more ready and more tractable, all fullenneſſe and frowardneſſe being caſt off, when the Ayre is pleaſant, and the calm gentle winds blow as in the Spring of the year. But that all things may be done by rule, I ſhall ſet down the conditions, effects, forces, and Names of all the winds that are known both to learned and ignorant men. Whereby every man may decline what ſeems to be hurtfull, and may ſafely expoſe himſelf to ſuch winds that ſeem to be health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and harmleſſe.

                  <p>But at Midſummer, when the Sun is hot, the Eaſtern wind cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth heat, and kindles yellow choller, and from the inflammation thereof burning Feavers ſpring up: But in the winter it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what milder, and not ſo ſharp and cold as the North-wind. The Eaſt-wind called <hi>Eurus</hi> is kind to the true Eaſt-wind,<note place="margin">The place of the Eaſt wind and effects.</note> and declines a little on the left hand towards the South, it is called <hi>Eurus</hi> from <hi>Aura,</hi> becauſe when the Sun firſt riſeth, it cauſeth gentle blaſts, they commonly call it Eaſt South-Eaſt;<note place="margin">Eaſt South-Eaſt cauſeth the Plague ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</note> for it is in that point of the world, next to the Eaſt. In Summer it is very hot, and cauſeth burning Feavers: And I have oft obſerved it in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that when any popular diſeaſe ſpreads, as it doth when that wind blows, it cauſeth Carbuncles and contagious ſwellings to riſe in the groin, and under the Arm-pits, and the Meaſils and ſmall Pox that boil forth to the outmoſt skin. For this wind partaking of a warm beat, namely ſome moiſture being mingled with it, it affords ſome cauſe of corruption, and inflammation to the bloud. But in Winter it cauſeth extream cold weather,<note place="margin">Eaſt South-Eaſt is moſt cold in Winter.</note> that is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended with ſnow, and bitter froſts, ſo that ſuch as go forth when this wind blows, can hardly defend their noſes, faces, eyes, cheeks, from the piercing and deadly cold of it: and the ſame force is aſcribed by ſome to North-Eaſt wind,<note place="margin">The nature of the North-Eaſt wind.</note> that is a very fierce blaſt, and differs ſomething from the Eaſt South-Eaſt. The South-Eaſt wind is next the South, which in Summer for the moſt part is calm, though ſometime it not onely troubles the Ayre with clouds, but the minds of men alſo. For this wind being turbulent makes the mind melancholly; but it laſts not long, for it is no ſharp bitter wind to ſtir the humours as ſome winds are. But as the waves of the ſea by the violence of the winds,<note place="margin">A ſimile from the waves of the Sea toſſed with the winds.</note> ſwell and are lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up, ſo in mans body the humours are moved and rage, by the ſame force, the vapours and ſumes whereof carried upwards, trouble the mind and make it peeviſh, froward, angry, hard, and untractable,<note place="margin">The winds di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper mans mind alſo.</note> that whilſt that diſtemper of the affections laſt, you ſhall hardly obtain any petition from thoſe men, eſpecially from women, or covetous old men: who as they are jealous, and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, they think that men craftily come to delude them,<note place="margin">Opportunity to be taken.</note> and therefore they will repell them with great incivility and give them ill language, unleſſe they come very ſeaſonably and in good time that is the chiefeſt of all things.

                  </q>
                  <p>Since therefore there are many things that are apt to change
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53844:104"/>mans condition, eſpecially the concourſe of the winds and unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motions of the Ayre can do it, by whoſe violence not onely our bodies but our animal ſpirits ſuffer wrong, and the mind it ſelf is ſomewhat diſtemper'd that as the Ayre and winds vary, ſo is it calm or troubled; though the diet and Intemperance in meats and drinks is of great concernment, to conſtitute the habit of the body, and to foſter our affections.<note place="margin">The South Wind is unſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> The South wind amongſt them all is moſt hurtfull and offenſive to mans health, being by nature and operation hot and moiſt. For when that wind blows, the rain wets the earth abundantly,<note place="margin">What diſeaſes the South wind cauſeth.</note> whence it is that our bodies and humours are ſoon corrupted, and Catarrhs and defluxions fall upon our throats, vocal artery, and Lungs. Whence ariſe Poſes, hoarſneſſe, Coughs, Epilepſies, Vertigoes, Lethargies, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, Blear-eyes, deafneſſe, noiſe in the Ears, and many more diſeaſes, that ſcatter every where when the South-wind blows. I have obſerved oft that when the South-wind blew long,<note place="margin">The South wind cauſeth abortion.</note> great bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied women did miſcarry, and by an immoderate flux ariſing, to have been in danger of their lives. For when the parts of the body that ſerve to carry the burden, begin to flag, namely the ligaments Nerves, Muſcles, Membranes, Flaps, Cauls, and the Matrix from too great moiſture, begins to grow ſlippery and to be dilated by degrees; it cannot be that nature ſhould carry the burden to the full time, eſpecially when after a dry time moiſt weather falls in, which as it is not hurtfull for dry and cholerick people,<note place="margin">The South wind not ill for cholerick people.</note> ſo is it extream ill for women and children and flegmatique conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſuch as dwell in boggy and fenny lands.<note place="margin">The South wind naught for flegmatique people.</note> Hence Infants and children are troubled with an implacable cough, the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutch call it <hi>Kindthoeſt</hi> that comes forth with a kind of Hiccop, and will give them no time ſo much as to take their breath. For when they cough continually and painfully, and never ſtop at all:<note place="margin">A cough ill from liquid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</note> yet all their ſtraining is in vain, nor do they prevail a whit, ſo that their breath is ſtopt, and they are ready to be ſtrangled, and all their Pipes of breathing being ſhut,<note place="margin">A cough that ſtrangleth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> their breath that goes and comes will come forth behind and break out, not without great danger of their lives, if you do not hold their buttocks cloſe preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed together with both your knees; that ſo the breath that ſtrives to come out behind the wrong way, may be forced to return back, and come forth at the wind pipes as it ſhould. This kind of cough comes by a thin fluxible humour that doth not clot, and grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether but falls into the receptacles of the Lungs; ſo that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and power of nature cannot caſt up ſo moiſt an excrement that is not compacted together.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A</hi> ſimile from a moiſt running matter.</note> For as a drop of water or any other liquor powred on a table doth not cleave together, but runs all abroad, ſo that you cannot take it up with the tops of your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; ſo the humours falling from the head upon the throat, the vocal artery and Lungs, and fibres, cannot be taken away, though nature by a continuall cough ſtrives to drive it forth, yet all in vain, and yet it is ſo thin that it cannot be touched but it will ſlip away; alſo groſſe flegme that ſticks to the Lungs like Birdlime,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53844:105"/>troubles men as much as thin matter doth, but it doth not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſtrangle us. Wherefore it is the South winds that are the cauſe of theſe diſeaſes, and inconveniencies in our health, and are the ſeminary of many more infirmities. For the humours being melted and flowing up and down,<note place="margin">The South wind cauſeth the joynt-Gout to move.</note> the Gout and joynt aches are ſtirred up, whereby all the parts of our bodies being afflicted, they become unapt to perform their duties. But as for the internall forces and offices of the mind, the mind when the South wind blows,<note place="margin">The South wind hurts the mind.</note> is feeble, ſtupid, dull, dejected, and caſt down, and ſleepy, that ſhe goes drowſily about all her buſineſſe. And this force puts forth it ſelf in inanimate and dead things. For we ſee that when the South wind blows, all things in the houſe are moiſt and flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, Linnen Clothes, Sheets, cover-lids, blankets, Paper, skins, pictures Geographical,<note place="margin">The South wind over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouds all, and the North clears all up.</note> and the reſt of the houſhold ſtuff. Alſo Lakes and Mooriſh places, Rivers, Ponds, Seas, are muddy and troubled, and dark: But when the Northwinds blow, all things are clear, lightſome, pure, and cleanſed, that you may ſee the bottom and all things that are on the ground under water. The like happens in our bloud and humours, the dregs whereof ſwim up when the South wind blows, and darken the mind: but when the Eaſt wind or Weſt blow they hide themſelves again, and ſink down, and ſo it is when other pleaſing winds do blow, hence it is that mens minds are very cheerfull,<note place="margin">Clear Ayre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth the mind.</note> and ready, when the Sun ſhines fair: but there is a great contraction, ſadneſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the mind, when the Ayre is clowdy and the winds boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous. For the ſame reaſon, when it begins to be rainy weather, and when the South, or South-weſt wind blows, Sinks, Lakes, Ponds,<note place="margin">When the South wind blows the Lakes ſtink.</note> Jakes, Privies, Common-ſhores, and other places appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cleanſe away filth, do ſend forth ſtinking vapours, and make our meats naught, that they will not keep ſo long.</p>
                  <p>Collateral and middle winds, which decline ſomewhat from the South, and bend ſomewhat toward the Weſt in winter, have the ſame force that the South and South-Weſt winds have,<note place="margin">South South-Weſt winds nature.</note> to which is referred South South-Weſt. For from that part of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there ruſheth forth a turbulent clowdy wind, not leſſe hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the body than to the mind. For violent blaſts have ſuch force, that they move the humours within the body, like to the Pump in ſhips: and the mind being ſtirred with the vapours and fumes thereof, is diſtempered, falls into paſſions, grows angry, tumultuous, unquiet, and rageth, and overflows like to the Ocean; and evill ſpirits and Devills do ſometimes joyn with the tempeſts, and adminiſter fuell,<note place="margin">Evill ſpirits are ready to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.

But again, when the Ayre is calm and clear, and free from violent winds; theſe people will be courteous to all, pleaſing, gentle, aſtable, merry, jeſting; yet ſo as they will not leave off to expreſſe ſome ridiculous cuſtomes, whereby you may eaſily gueſſe what habit of body they are of, and what is the conſtitution of their minds.</p>

But when Autumn ends, and the courſe of the year in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to Winter, Weſtern winds do rage fiercely and ſhake the Earch and the Sea with great tempeſts; and they are no leſſe hurtfull and pernicious in cauſing cold flegmatique diſeaſes, than the Southern winds are.<note place="margin">North-Weſt winds and others near to it, what is their nature.</note> But winds near the Weſt and North are reckned to be three, Weſt North-Weſt, North-Weſt that blows from the Weſtern ſolſtice, North North-Weſt; and all theſe are violent winds, that fiercely ſhake the Sea-waves, and breaking down rocks and ſhores, drive the Seas far into the Land.

And as theſe winds cauſe diſeaſes and Feavers, and many inconveniencies to mans health, ſo alſo they are hurtfull to fruitfull land and tilled grounds, hindring the ſeed time, and a plentifull crop. For the Earth when it is blowed upon by chill winds,<note place="margin">A chill Ayre ill enough.</note> will no leſſe bring forth unwholeſome hearbs, then it doth when it is over-wet with cold unpleaſing rain, alſo it ſends up Darnel, Cockle, wild-Tares, Briers, Buſhes, Thorns, Docks, all which choak the ſeed and Plants, if they be not carefully pulled up by the roots. Next to theſe is the North wind, Italians call it <hi>Tramontano,</hi> bending a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towards the Eaſt, North North-Eaſt, and North-Eaſt holds the middle place between the Summer or Solſtitial Sun-riſing. But Eaſt North-Eaſt is environed by the North-Eaſt.<note place="margin">The nature of the Northern Wind.</note> The North wind is by nature and effect cold and dry, commonly clear, yet ſometimes rainy, but it abates the violence of North-Weſt, and of vehement Southern winds. For when they have raged as much as they can, and are almoſt weary, they commonly conclude in a North-wind, ſo that preſently the Ayre grows calm, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt ends; wherefore the Inhabitants deſire onely that thoſe winds might be changed into this, for if they turn toward the South, the Tempeſt grows more raging, and collects new forces: whence it is that many great Ships and veſſels are endangered,<note place="margin">The North and South winds cauſe Catarrhs by a diverſe reaſon.</note> and almoſt in the very havens entrance, and fall upon ſhelves and Quick-ſands and fords, where they are broken in pieces, to the Merchants incredible damage and loſſe of his Merchandiſe. Wherefore the North wind is not onely more healthfull, than the North-Weſt, or South-Weſt; but alſo more calm, and more mild
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53844:106"/>in raiſing of tempeſts: though in winter ſometimes it be fierce, and blow violently, whence it cauſeth Catarrhs, Pleureſies,<note place="margin">The North and South winds cauſe Catarrhs by a diverſe reaſon.</note> Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but by a different reaſon from the South wind. For when the South-wind blows, the humours are melted, and diſſolve of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo run from the head to the parts that are under it. But when the North wind blows, becauſe the Muſcles are thereby bound, and ſo are the Membranes, flegme is preſſed forth, as when we cruſh a ſponge of water between our fingers;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A</hi> ſimile from preſſing of a Sponge.</note> clinching our hand together to wring it our. But what time ſoever of the year theſe winds blow, they make the body cold, they ſtop the pores, they diſſipate contagions of the Ayre, and keeping in natural heat they help concoction. The Southern winds by diſſolving the frame of the body, and affecting the limbs with faintneſſe and idleneſſe, make men ſleepy, dull, ſlothfull, nauſeating, and unfit to perform any duties or function. But the North winds, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">L. <hi>3.</hi> Aph.</note> make men active, lightſome, merry, lively, ſtirring, and fit for all employments, eſpecially ſuch as are of a more moiſt temper, for they better fulfill the gifts and functions of Nature, and all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed more healthfully with them, as a moiſt ſtate and condition of the Ayre is moſt wholeſome for dry withered bodies.<note place="margin">South and North winds the chief in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Ayre.</note> For ſo they are the leſſe chill'd with cold, or burnt with heat. Since therefore theſe two winds, North and South, and thoſe that border upon them, do conſtitute almoſt in all <hi>Europe</hi> the yearly changes, I think that theſe two ſhould be chiefly regarded. For no wind through the whole courſe of the year blows more conſtantly: For one of them having done blowing the other begins, and keeps its ſtation; yet the other winds I ſpake of before keep their turns, but they ſooner leave off, and give out. Wherefore we muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to theſe two winds, not onely for preſervation of our health, and driving away inconveniencies, but when we undertake a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by Sea or land expoſed to the open Ayre. For I have found this by long experience, that the North-wind riſing in the night will not laſt long and ſtand, nor keep that point for three dayes together, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confirms, and <hi>Homer</hi> ſhews, whil'ſt he taxed the errours of <hi>Uliſſes.</hi>

The like compacted ſubſtance grows in the former and hinder feet of ſheep, in the very part they tread on the earth with, and it is round faſhioned like to a Worm, being inwardly full of down, like haires, ſuch as we find in the little ſponges, and buttons of Roſes, that the ſeed is ſhut up in, folded in with a ſoft and tender down: I have oft times taken ſuch a thing out of the boyld ſheeps-feet, that was like a round Worm that breeds in rotten wood, or ſmall-nuts. And if any man eating ſheeps-feet, ſhould be ignorant or careleſſe of it, and not take out that ſubſtance, he will preſently loath after eating it, and be ready to vomit every moment, and to break wind upward.

Yet Shepherds and ſuch as keep ſheep, are of that opinion that no creature could run ſwifter than a ſheep, or out-goe him, but that he would out-run them all, unleſſe there were ſome ſuch ſubſtance under his joynts, that he treads upon.

Since therefore a Hog delights in mud and filth, and to wallow in dirt; the firſt care muſt be to provide for him a clean ſty and wholeſome food, if you would have the meat of him to be wholeſome for you to eat; for if you feed this creature with husks, and fat him with beaſtly food, he will grow Meaſly, and full of kernels, and hard ſwellings, ſo that his fleſh will be unwholeſome, and naught and infectious to the whole body. And this was the principal cauſe the Jews were forbidden to eat Hogs fleſh,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Levit.</hi> 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.</note> and it was a great wickedneſſe for them to taſte thereof. But theſe hard ſwellings and kernells come chiefly about their necks, becauſe they are greedy and devouring, and eat all things upon Dung-hills without making any difference. By the name of Meaſils is meant that diſeaſe that pollutes the whole body with a foul matter,<note place="margin">What is the Meaſils i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Hogs.</note> becauſe the fleſh and inward parts are tainted with little white knots like hailſtones. For ſome kind of whitiſh ſwellings are in all parts ſcattered here and there, and the certain tokens thereof are ſeen under the tongue, when Hogheards put Irons into their mouths, that they may try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſound to be killed, and cut forth for meat. Thoſe that have the Leproſy do ſhew forth ſome ſuch matter in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all their bodies: for the puſhes that break forth in the our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

The fleſh indeed of this creature when it is Meaſly is ſweet and well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the taſte; but it is very unwholeſome, and next kind to the Leproſy,<note place="margin">Fleſh that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly juice is ſavoury.</note> by reaſon of the mixture of melancholly juice. So fleſh next the bones is not unſavoury, or of ill taſte to the Palate, becauſe it partakes of Melancholly juice, for bones are made of ſuch juice, and grow together of it. But what the Leproſy and the French-Pox doth to a man, the ſame doth the Meaſils and ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous tumours, to a hog: for theſe diſeaſes are of kin, and very near allyed one to the other; their names onely are different but the matter is the ſame,<note place="margin">What <hi>Aetius</hi> ſaith of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Hogs.</note> as alſo <hi>Aetius</hi> the Phyſitian obſerved in his chapter <hi>de Elephantiaſi.</hi> Wherefore that men might ſuffer no hurt by the uſe of eating this unclean creature, with us there is a wholeſome Law provided by the Senate, that no Sow nor Hog ſhall be killed unleſſe his Tongue be firſt pulled forth and ſearched whether he be ſick of this diſeaſe, for if warty puſhes ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in his Tongue and Jaws, and the veins are of a wan colour, and blackiſh, theſe are ſigns that the internalls are of an ill conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and therefore it is thought fit not to kill them; or if they be killed ignorantly, that they muſt be buried under ground. And if no ſuch thing appear, they that are appointed Judges of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, do pronounce that the Hog is ſound and fit for to be eaten. But becauſe oft-times this creature may be faulty though he be ſound in that reſpect; Wherefore our Countrey people when they kill a Hog,<note place="margin">The briſly skin of the Hog is to be burnt.</note> cover him with ſtraw, and burn the hide, rather than ſcald it with water. For if there be any defect or ill matter under the skin, the fire will draw forth the contagion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, which hot water cannot do ſo well, and to purge away all filth. This way are polluted Sows cured, if the ſtyes wherein they lye be daily made clean, and that they may walk up and down in them. For thoſe that wander up and down in woods and Copſes,<note place="margin">Hogs wandring in Woods are the moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</note> and feed on Acorns for the moſt part, are more wholeſome than thoſe that uſe no exerciſe, but are ſhut up in their ſtyes, for they are leſſe expoſed to diſeaſes. Moreover they muſt have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of water given them to waſh themſelves withall, and ſome Salt mingled therewith, and when they eat Barly or any ſolid meat Bay-berries bruiſed muſt be put thereto. And that kind of ſhell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, the Dutch call <hi>Moſſelen,</hi> whereof there are abundance on our ſhores, and Sea-coaſts, Hogs are wonderfully refreſhed with, if you give them the decoction of them in great quantity. Alſo the Lees and dregs of Wine, and the feculent ſwillings that are left when the juice is preſſed forth of the Grapes, are a preſent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to expell this diſeaſe, eſpecially if Bran and the lump fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted commonly called <hi>Mout</hi> be mingled therewith. But our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people neither take care of theſe creatures, nor for the health of thoſe that muſt eat them: for they give their hogs, the ſowre corrupt Lees of Beer and Ale, and ſtinking waſh that is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of their Tubs, and all filthy things, as rotten and mouldy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Pears; whereby thoſe kernels, and Meaſils, and inward

But beſides thoſe four feet, or armes ſtretched forth on both ſides, in the former part where their eyes ſhine and ſtick forth, there are two toothed Pincers wherewith they take
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53844:116"/>faſt hold of all things they meet with, and bite the hands of thoſe that catch them moſt cruelly, ſo that having but once taken hold, they can hardly be pulled off.

                  <p>THough a little before I treated of the Nature, and neceſſary uſe of Salt; yet it will be worth the while, to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more largely of this wholeſome ſauce, without which all meats are unſavoury, and without taſte.

But if it be preſently or after ſome dayes, whil'ſt it is yet warm of the fire, taken for uſe it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly melt, and diſſolve into a ſalt water, ſo that it will leave a mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy kind of moiſture on things that are ſalted with it. So Salt that is firſt taken out of the hot veſſel, or Iron Cauldron, and is not
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53844:118"/>hardned by age, or grown faſt together, whereas it ſooner melts into brine than it is fit it ſhould,<note place="margin">New Salt ſoon melts, but old laſts longer.</note> otherwiſe than old Salt doth; I hold not ſo good to ſalt or ſeaſon meats with. Wherefore they that would have all ſalted meats, fiſh called Saperdae, Cod-fiſh, Sea-calves,<note place="margin">What Salt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſalted meats.</note> Tunies, Herrings, that are a kind of <hi>Thryſsae,</hi> to laſt long, that is to be kept for the next year, or till the Summer be very hot, and would carry into farther Countries things that ſhould not ſtink,<note place="margin">What kind of fiſh is <hi>Triſſae.</hi>
                     </note> let them remember that old Salt is beſt to ſeaſon them with.<note place="margin">A new way to make Salt.</note> Our Anceſtors formerly made ſalt to their great profit, not of Sea-water congealed and hardned into Salt by the heat of the Sun, ſuch as is brought from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to us, but of the clods of the Sea, burnt to aſhes, which by powring in water by degrees, they made Salt of that was very clear and bright: the people and Inhabitants called it <hi>Zel</hi> or <hi>Zilzout,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">From Salt comes Silt and Sold.</note> from the clods that were full of Salt, from whence it is taken: and all the Low-Countries unto our daies uſed no other kind of Salt.<note place="margin">Whence in the German tongue comes <hi>Solda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</hi>
                     </note> But when that kind of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Salt grew out of uſe by another way brought in from other parts, a new way was invented, that is no leſſe gainfull then the former. For coorſe, black, dirty, ſalt, being brought in from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Aquitan,</hi> our Country men take forth the mud and filth, and make it exceeding white,<note place="margin">How the Zelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders make Salt white.</note> and fit for uſe to preſerve meats. Alſo our Salt-makers uſe another way of boyling Salt, that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not much from the former. For every third or fourth year they break up their hearths and floors,<note place="margin">The making Salt of clods.</note> they call it <hi>Den heert,</hi> with a fork, and a large veſſel being ſet upon it, and made hot with fire put under it, they caſt the clots and pieces, that are wet with a briny ſalt liquor that drops from them abundantly into the veſſel, and theſe they break ſmall and ſoke in Sea-water, and boyl them; after a few hours the muddy dregs will ſink down to the bottom, and moſt white Salt is drawn forth.<note place="margin">What is <hi>Cleyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zout</hi> in <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> They call this kind <hi>Cleyn zout,</hi> or <hi>Cliync zout,</hi> for that the clots of it ſtruck one againſt the other like flints for hardneſſe, will make a clanging noiſe.</p>
                  <p>This kind of Salt is fit to bring to the Table to adorn it with, and is uſefull for many things: yet is it not ſo good to preſerve things. Wherefore they rub Cow-hides, and skins with this ſalt, and cover them with it, as they do alſo with coorſe Sea-ſalt. Wherefore the Senate made a Law, that no man ſhould ſell ſuch ſalt,<note place="margin">The Senates Law not to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticate Salt.</note> unleſſe he would teſtify upon oath, that he ſold it not for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and natural Salt, that is made of Sea Salt, and the brine of it, but for foſſil Salt, that is dug up and made by Art, leſt there ſhould be any fraud, and impoſture uſed. For being it is as white as Snow, and hath all the marks of the beſt Salt, ignorant people cannot eaſily diſcern it, or obſerve the difference unleſſe they prove it by ſuch things that uſe to be ſeaſoned with it. For ſalt meats and other things ſeaſoned and ſalted with this ſalt will ſooner ſtink, and ſmell rank, when you think to keep them till Summer be far ſpent.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53844:118"/>and burn and torrefie it a long time. This Salt is clear, bright, ſhining, ſightly, crumbly, cruſty with large broad, kales, and pieces that blink like Starrs, that is wonderfully deſired by thoſe of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> both daily, and chiefly for their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick uſe, whenſoever they make great Feaſts and Banquets, to furniſh their Tables with.

                  <p>For in the low Countries thoſe that live by the Sea, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, uſe to dye after a diverſe manner, according as the humours abound in them.<note place="margin">Fat people are in danger when the Sea flows.</note> For ſome by the courſe of the Moon, by whoſe motion the Sea is driven, when the waters flow, others when they ebb, either recover or dye; the humours and Spirits being either toſſed or quieted by the motion and aſpect of this Starr; So in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Criſis, that is, in giving judgment of life and death upon all thoſe, that I obſerved to be troubled with diſeaſes from fullneſſe of humours, or with inflammation of the Lungs, Pleure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Quinſeys, Apoplexies, Lethargies, and Flegmatick diſeaſes, and Dropſies, whoſe bodies do ſwell, and the moyſture chokes them, I pronounce that when the Moon is at the full, and when the tide comes in, thoſe perſons will dye, or elſe the moſt of them, according to the condition and nature of the diſeaſe, will ſuffer ſome manifeſt alteration, by ſudden breaking forth of ſweat, or blood, or evacuation, and flux of humours that abound in ſome part;<note place="margin">Dry bodies dye when the Sea goes out.</note> then I give my judgment, that hectical people, that is, ſuch as are lean and conſumed, &amp; dry for want of nutriment, and old decayd decrepit people will dye when the tide goeth forth, and the Moon is hid.

So they that are ſwoln with water, or have full and fat bodies, if they lye ſick of a dangerous diſeaſe, that comes from fullneſſe of humours, they dye preſently when the floods riſe, and the Moon is either new, or in the full; ſome when the waters are in the mid'ſt between both,<note place="margin">Sound people ſo well as ſick feel the force of the Moon.</note> and others dye when it is full high water. On the contrary dry bodies, lean, ſtravlings, wan, bloodleſſe, waſted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dye eaſily, when the tide goeth out, and the Moon haſteth to the

And not onely ſick mens bodies are affected with theſe externall cauſes; but alſo thoſe that are ſound, feel the forces of the Moon's effects: but the more any man declines from a ſound tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the more is he ſubject to pains, and to the change of the Ayre and of the Moon, eſpecially when in ſuch bodies there are vicious humours. So when the Moon is in the firſt quarter, or when ſhe is full, and a cold wind blows, the Muſcles, Membranes, Nerves, Pannicles, tendons Wax ſtiff, and being contracted and wreſted, they endure ſharpe pains. Thus much of the Moon's force and efficacy, and of the motion of the Sea, which let no man think to be vain, or old Wives Fables, and ſo reject it; for there is nothing more certain than this, or more conſonant to truth: for experience confirms this, and reaſon makes it good, even in things inanimate and that want ſenſe. For the hairy skins of ſeal-Calves taken off,<note place="margin">The Nature of ſome skins in rayſing up hair.</note> will grow ſtiffe, and the haire will ſtand upright, when the Sea comes in; and when the Sea goes out they fall down againe, and this <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of.

                  <p>SInce the Countrey of <hi>Zeland</hi> affords ſo many things that are uſefull for life, and for the good of other Nations; I wonder that ſo many people ſhould ſo undervalue this Countrey, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it.

To theſe we may add the commodity for Havens, and ſafe places for ſhips to ride in, where every Nation comes, and they are moſt fit for ſailing to any part of the world they pleaſe to ſet forth for, nor do they want able Marriners and Pilots for that work, who have ſailed over all the ſecret parts of the Sea. But how fat and rich the ground is, and how fruitfull the fields are and what great heards there are of Cattle and ſheep, hardly any man will believe but he that ſees it; as alſo the moſt plentifull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture land to fat cattle with, not onely within the hills and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, but alſo without near the Sea-ſhores, in the very creeks of the Ocean, where there wander up and down ſome millions of cattle that are a great profit for Merchants, and vaſt gain; and they are not onely greater than ordinary, but very dainty meat, by reaſon of the ground and graſſe, which affords them ſuch wholeſome fodders, that ſtrangers are exceedingly taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; ſo that Pettifoggers, that is ſuch as are given to follow controverſies,<note place="margin">Advocates take bribes.</note> can gratify Advocates and Procurators no better with any bribes (excepting Gold) than when they preſent them with a <hi>Zeland</hi> weather, that hath a good fleece, to ſtore their Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin with; for then they take the buſineſſe to heart, and follow the cauſe hard: and if a great ſheeps-milk-Cheeſe that is green,

                     </note> and not ſo wholeſome as their neighbour countries chiefly in Summer, by reaſon of the filthy ſmells of lakes and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Pools, and becauſe there are but few trees growing there. Yet this convenience it hath,<note place="margin">Why the Ayre of <hi>Zeland</hi> is not ſoon infected.</note> that it is but little ſubject to contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and peſtilent diſeaſes, and is long before it be infected: but once being infected, it will range unmeaſurably, and will not eaſily abate.<note place="margin">A ſimile from fire in things burning.</note> For as hard wood will not eaſily take fire, but being once on fire is hardly put out; ſo bodies hardned by Northern blaſts and Sea Ayre, do not eaſily admit of the venome, but once ſeized upon by the Plague, they can hardly get clear of it.

                     <note place="margin">Lib. de Morb.

Now this name of <hi>Mates,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whence are the <hi>Zelanders</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Mates.</hi>
                     </note> they have not given them from the place, or ſome Captain, or otherwiſe, but from their vulgar compellation, and manner of ſpeech one with another; for <hi>Mates,</hi> which in their ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe they uſe together, ſignifies as much as a companion of all actions, contracts, dangers, and a partner of all ones ſecrets, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and labours, that they take together.</p>
                  <p>So all thoſe that go in companies, or that buy and fell together, and as many as make an agreement or compact, and with full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of mind bring their goods into a common ſtock, in hopes of gain, by a cuſtome amongſt Sea-men, of which there is great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in theſe Countries, are in their native language called <hi>Mates,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">How the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> call a Colleague.</note> joyn'd in company together.

The name <hi>Zeland</hi> is but new, and was not known to the Antients, it is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Sea and land, as if you would ſay Land by the Sea: for it is compaſſed round with the Sea, and parted into many Iſlands,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zeland</hi> hath many Iſlands.</note> in all 15. yet the Sea but few years ſince did do a world of hurt to theſe Lands; by force and inundation whereof, great part of <hi>Zeland</hi> was overflowed, all the banks and Ramparts being broken down: yet ſome famous Iſlands remain, whereof three in ſpecial are alwaies arming themſelves againſt the Oceans violence: and with huge expence (which we can hardly perſwade the Prince and his Deputy to believe) ſcarce defend themſelves with great labour againſt this unruly element.

This Iſland, beſides ſome parcels of ground lately laid to it, (which our men call <hi>Polders,</hi>) is eight miles in compaſſe, as alſo <hi>Scheld,</hi> from which in a hundred years, are three hundred Acres torn off; is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and adorned with ſome beautifull villages and Towns, and there is one principal City in it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Middleburgh</hi> the chief Town.</note> or Mart Town where Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants frequent. and whereby it is made famous, called <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> that is <hi>Metellus</hi> his <hi>Burgh,</hi> who was a great Noble man, and a Conſul amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and from him many ſuppoſe it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed that name: but I think it had this denomination from its ſtrong fort and Caſtle, or unacceſſible rock and Tower,<note place="margin">What is <hi>Burgh</hi> in the German congue.</note> ſuch as was the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> which ſtands in the very middle and Center of this Iſland.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53844:125"/>ſupream power, and government of that place. Yet I deny not but it may be referred to the builder of it, by whom in ſuch a place this fort was rayſed againſt hoſtile Invaſions. There ſtands from <hi>Middlebourgh</hi> toward the South-Weſt, or Weſt, 16. furlongs which make two miles, a City not great in compaſſe about the walls, but well fenced by nature and Art toward the Sea, which we call <hi>Fluſhing,</hi>

For there are in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try many touchy, ſad, hawty, melancholique people, who are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the affects of Brabanders, and Flemings, who are not guided by the ſad Planets of Saturn or Mars,<note place="margin">Why the Zelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders love their Cups.</note> but by the jovial and merry Planets of Jove and Mercury, hence it is that the Zelanders deſiring to drive away thoſe penſive thoughts, ſtudy to be jovial, and with drink in abundance to drownd theſe cares and tortures of their-minds.

                  <head type="sub">Of a neutrall body, that is one that can be ſaid neither ſound nor ſick, but is of a tottering and doubtfull condition floting between both.</head>
                  <p>IT is confeſſed that the art of Phyſick was formerly divided into three parts. The firſt is that preſerves the preſent health, and carefully keeps off all inconveniences of ſickneſſe; The ſecond that which containes the reaſon, whereby the body may be fenced and defended, that it ſhall not eaſily fall into ſickneſſe; The laſt, that which cures the body of ſuch diſeaſes that it is fallen into: There are alſo thee conditions in mans body;<note place="margin">Three conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> though the contentions about theſe amongſt Phyſitians be needleſſe: one of good health, when the body enjoyes its perfect health without any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and no print of a diſeaſe is upon it: the ſecond of ſickneſſe, when remedies muſt be given to cure the body.<note place="margin">A ſimile from Hypocriſie.</note> The third is doubtfull and uncertain, in which there be ſome ſhews of a ſound man: as wicked men having a counterfeit poſture of integrity of life, but there is ſome ſecret affection in it, that makes it ſubject to fall down. Of which ſtate I obſerve two conditions that differ amongſt themſelves: one of that which hath already diſcuſſed the diſeaſe and wound it ſelfe from it, yet it is weak, feeble, exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of little force; which inconveniences of health, without
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53844:133"/>medicaments, may be reſtored by ſleep, and nouriſhing diet. For the like happeneth to him,<note place="margin">Some ſick men are bed-ridden others not. A ſimile from a Traveller ſet on by the way. <hi>Luc. 10.</hi>
                     </note> as to a Traveller that is got out of Theives hands, he yet pants and trembles, and is not wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored from the great fear and danger of his life he was in, nor yet fully come to himſelfe; (which our Saviour Chriſt, expreſſed by an elegant ſimilitude) but being refreſhed by his freinds to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, he begins to revive by degrees, and to caſt away fear: ſo a ſick man, though when his diſeaſe is gone, he begins to go abroad, and find all things better with him, yet ſome footſteps of the diſeaſe ſtay yet in his body, nor are all the accidents that uſe to accompany it, quite taken away and extinct. Another conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neere to this, yet ſomething worſe than this, is, whereby in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, a man ſeems to be well, and not ſick at all, but yet his body is full of vitious naughty humours.<note place="margin">Therap. 3.</note> Wherefore <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſets a diet for ſound men, ſick men, and for ſuch as begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; for the diet of ſuch as are growing well is a mean between thoſe that are ſound and ſick. For to theſe a thin diet is preſcribed, ſparing, frugal, moderate, as not to exceed the bounds of temperance for they cannot endure the leaſterrour, whereas ſtrong ſound men are not offended with the greateſt. So we give food to Infants and to ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but not as we give to men grown &amp; at full ſtrength,<note place="margin">Every man's Nature to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</note> who feed on Gammons of Bacon and Oxe fleſh willingly, and all ſolid meats; as their age is tender, as clothing to their bodies &amp; ſhooes to their feet, ſo as their body can endure it, muſt they have food and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick given them. And though ſome new writers are as ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in the art of Phyſick as ſome are in Religion, and have taken away the body that is neutrall,<note place="margin">Neutrall bodies taken away.</note> and will not endure to heare of it: yet I thought fit to ſpeak ſomthing of this. For ſuch a thing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termind by the nature of things, by daily uſe and cuſtome, and by the friendly diſcourſes of other men. Hence proceed thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of our friends and merry companions, if they aske how any man doth, what health he is in, how his body is diſpoſed, in what caſe,<note place="margin">The forms of asking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man's health.</note> place, ſtate he is, whether all be well, proſperous, lucky? to whom we uſe to anſwer in ſo many words; So ſo, indifferent, not very well, doubtfully, inclining, floting between both, inſtable, not ſound, not as we could wiſh, or would have it; ſometimes, Better, we hope the beſt, ſo well as he may, when he cannot be as he would. And in theſe kind of diſcourſes do all Nations ſpeak one with the other if at any time, they taking care of their friends condition, enquire how they do. And though moſt of theſe be quit of their diſeaſes, and others that are falling down, are not yet faſtned to their beds,<note place="margin">A ſimile from colours and young youth.</note> yet they ought not to be placed amongſt the ſound or ſick; but, partaking of both, into a neutrall condition, that is a mean between two extreames: as a brown colour which conſiſts of the mixture of white and black, and as young youth is a mean between Childhood and Manly-age; For ſince they do not natures Offices, and functions as ſound men do, nor yet lye in their beds as ſick men, that want the uſe of their Limbs; they cannot deſerve to be call'd ſound or ſick men, but as the vulgar cuſtome is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53844:133"/>to be called neutralls: ſome faculties and works of nature ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in them, but faintly, ſparingly, dully: for they walk and go, but it is ſlowly, and with a reeling inclining pace, that for want of forces, they muſt either lean on a ſtaff, or ſome bodies ſhoulder, as ſome that cannot ſwim,<note place="margin">A ſimile from ſwimming.</note> uſe Cork or Ruſhes to bear them up.</p>
                  <p>In like manner we may reaſon of ſleep and meat, for they ſit down at Table, and eat to live, but not with that appetite and deſire as ſound people do, whoſe beſt ſawce is hunger: they ſleep and are refreſhed thereby, but not ſo ſweet deep long ſleep, as ſome men, who tired with labour, ſleep quietly all the night.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the reaſon of ſeeing and quickneſſe of the eyes, and why ſome will ſee clearly things a great way off, and yet are blind cloſe by; others will ſee the ſmalleſt things near them exactly, but things afar off, though they be high mountains, they cannot diſcern eaſily; and why common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the right eye is duller than the left, and ſees not ſo clear. By the way concerning the colours of the eyes, and many other things, which are arguments of the mind: alſo ſome remedies for a dull eye.</head>
                  <p>AMongſt the many and great gifts of Nature, and moſt ample endowments,<note place="margin">The excellency of the mind.</note> wherewith Man is adorned by the beſt and greateſt God abundantly, there is nothing better and more divine than the mind of man: to which, ſince all the ſenſes ſerve and obey, yet principally the miniſtery of ſight and ſpeaking are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by him, when he will explain his mind.<note place="margin">The beginning of ſight is from the brain.</note> For in this we principally excell beaſts, that we have power to expreſſe the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our minds, and bring forth our counſels by words: ſo in the eyes the vertue of ſeeing is not wholly placed, but they are as two windows of the ſoul, that ſtand open from the ſeat of the mind unto the eyes; by the intending and remitting motion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy whereof, the motions and cogitations of our minds are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. The faculty of ſeeing conſiſts indeed in the eye or that clear tranſparent chryſtalline humour, which that it may be moiſt with a watry humour, which men call the white;<note place="margin">A ſimile from a Jewel ſet in Gold.</note> ſo doth it ſwim and is ſet within the glaſſy humour, and it doth illuſtrate the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the eye, that is the ſight we ſee with, with ſuch a ſhining brightneſſe, as a clear and excellent Jewel doth a ring. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſight is attributed to the eyes, not as to the principal place, but as being the organ or inſtrument of it, for the brain by the viſual nerves ſends ſpirits to them, whereby the faculty of ſeeing is performed. For when the brain is hurt or ill affected, (though the eyes be well) the ſight grows dull,<note place="margin">The head hurt hurts the ſight.</note> and the ſharpneſſe of the eyes is darkned, which is proper to drunkards, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards and thoſe that are in feavers. Wherefore by this reaſon is ſight aſcribed to the eyes, that conſiſt of three humours, and four Coats; becauſe they are guided by the brain and mind that have the chief power;<note place="margin">Kingly power in the brain.</note> for from them proceed and flow by the optick or viſual nerves, pure, clear, thin, bright ſpirits: whereby if the dark Ayre hinder not, or ſome depraved conſtitution of the eyes, ſight is performed exactly. But if they be diminiſhed, obſcure, troubled, ſlender, the ſight of the eye is made dim, and not ſo ſharp: but from the temper of the eyes, there grow divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and reaſons of ſight. For he that hath plenty of ſpirits, and perfectly pure, that are clean, well-poliſhed, as a clear chryſtal glaſſe, he can ſee exactly things that are far remote. For when that humour is perfectly wrought, there flows from it a thin and ſincere vapour, or light ſpirit, whereby chiefly ſight is performed,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53844:135"/>and things at a great diſtance may be diſcerned. For when the animal ſpirit is much,<note place="margin">Who hath the beſt ſight.</note> and plentifull, ſubtile, thin, and heavenly, it carrieth the ſight a great way, and ſees all things clearly, nor is it eaſily wearied with continuall looking, or a fixed intending of it,<note place="margin">The ſanguine have ſtrong ſights.</note> and the moiſt and hot ſpirit hath this faculty, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſanguine complexion. But where the ſpirit is but little, yet pure and not cloudy, he can ſee things near at hand clearly and diſtinctly, and hath a certain choice, but things at a diſtance or ſomething farther off, he ſees not ſo clearly. For a little and mean ſpirit is eaſily diſſolved and vaniſheth, and cannot carry the ſight ſo far. Whence it comes that ſuch as have the organ of ſight furniſhed with a clear, but yet ſmall ſpirit, will ſee the ſmalleſt characters without hurting their ſight, but great mountains far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, or rocks that are capes at Sea, they cannot ſee ſo well, which happens to a hot and dry or cholerick complexion. But why ſome do ſee things hard by them but meanly,<note place="margin">Cholerick ſee clearly.</note> and things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant not at all, proceeds from want of ſpirits, and groſſeneſſe of them.<note place="margin">What ſight a groſſe ſpirit makes.</note> But where the ſpirits are plentifull and groſſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thicker than ordinary, that man can long endure to look on a thing, and not be weary to behold it long and ſtedfaſtly that is obvious to his ſight, and he can ſee at the firſt glance, but cannot exactly diſtinguiſh things: for groſſeneſſe hinders ſharp ſight; which may be obſerved in a cold or moiſt complexion, which is the flegmatique.<note place="margin">A moyſt and ſmall ſpirit, what ſight it makes.</note> But he that hath a moiſt and mean animal ſpirit, to ſerve the organ or ſight, he can neither ſee things near hand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, nor at all things afar off; for a few ſpirits ſoon vaniſh, and are diſperſed: but groſſe ones hinder the function of ſight; ſince the rays that proceed from the ſight of the eyes are not carried to the object, nor do they receive the ſpecies of things that come to the eye from without.<note place="margin">A thin and rare ſpirit binders the ſight when ſpectacles are good.</note> But a rare, thin, ſlender, dark ſpirit, ſuch as is in old decayed people, and ſuch as are waſted by ſickneſſe, doth make a weak ſight, and almoſt none at all: wherefore they do well to help their dull ſight with ſpectacles, for by them all things ſeem bigger, and the viſual ſpirits are reſtored, and collected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one, they do not vaniſh and diſperſe ſo much: but I adviſe no man to uſe them too ſoon, for when they want them, they will be quite blind. For that theſe are dark and grow blind, comes from want of ſpirits. Wherefore ſpectacles refreſh the ſight, becauſe the rays are reflected and retorted by them,<note place="margin">Spectacles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the ſight.</note> and the ſpirits gain ſtrength, new ones continually coming thither from the brain. But there are beſides theſe things ſpoken of, many more, that dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the eyes, and either hurt or hinder the ſight. For if the pupil chance to be moved from its place,<note place="margin">How many things hinder the ſight.</note> or be dilated too much, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, contracted, or diminiſhed, or from ſome ſtroke or wound, fall or contuſion be tumefied or inflamed, the faculty of ſeeing is wonderfully offended:<note place="margin">Eyes that ſtick out or ſink in are dark.</note> alſo eyes that ſtick out too far, or ſink in too deep, do bring ſome inconvenience to our ſight; for prominent eyes are hurt by the external light, ſo that in the clear Ayre, and Sun ſhine they ſee not their objects well; for the immoderate
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53844:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>light hinders them; but if the skye be dark and clowdy, they ſee the better; hence it is that they ſee perfectly what is near them but things afar off darkly and obſcurely; again, ſuch whoſe eyes lye hid and deep within, and their balls ſtick leſſe without their eye-lids, are contrary to the former. For theſe ſee things hard by not ſo diſtinctly, but they ſee things afar off very well;<note place="margin">Hid eyes and ſuch as ſtick forth are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſeeing.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we would ſee things afar off we half ſhut our eyes, and wink almoſt, for ſo the ſpirits compacted and heaped together do ſend forth their rayes very far. Hence we uſe to wink with one eye, and put a vail before it, which may darken the Ayre, and hinder the light, whereby we can more forcibly and fixedly look upon the object; as men do that ſhoot in Guns and Croſſe-bows; for they ſhutting their left eye,<note place="margin">From Archers a reaſon for ſight is taken.</note> the ſpirits run more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully to the right, and make the ſight ſtronger: therefore Archers ayme thus, and ſo come to hit the mark they ſhoot at.

But the heart,<note place="margin">The heart lives firſt, and dies laſt.</note> the fountain of life begins firſt to live, and dieth laſt, and being taken forth of ſome living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, will pant a long time after: yet the eyes which are thought to be perfected laſt, firſt ceaſe to move and ſhew ſigns of death:<note place="margin">The eyes dye firſt.</note> and they dye before the reſt, becauſe the ſpirits being taken from them when death comes, they muſt vaniſh, or the ſpirits are drawn back from the eyes to the brain, that is the beginning of motion and ſight.

But eyes that are all with black colour (whoſe beauty if the eye-lids be of the ſame colour make a man ſeem comely) proceed from this,<note place="margin">Whence come black eyes.</note> when the viſible ſpirit is weak, and the humour plentifull, thick, dark, and ſhady, ſo that one cannot ſee through it, by reaſon of the abounding hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and the profundity of it: for no light that comes from our eyes, is carried into his eyes that ſtands over againſt us, but the rayes flye back again, and are as it were retorted upon us. So in Fountains and ciſterns,<note place="margin">Why the water ſhews black in wells.</note> and deep pits, the water ſeems to be black, and ſerves for a Looking glaſſe, the ſight of the eyes being beaten back by the thickneſſe of the water, and reflected upon it ſelf; for it forceth back our ſight upon us.<note place="margin">What ſight black eyes have.</note> But black eyes are of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and condition, that they ſee clearly by day, becauſe the day light runs into theſe dark ſhady eyes, and moves and enlightens the ſpirits.

They that have ſuch eyes ſee weakly, and confuſedly by day, becauſe the day light, and brightneſſe of the Sun diſſolves and diſſipates the viſual ſpirits that are not very ſtrong: but in the night, becauſe the organs of ſight are enlightned with a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and imbred light, the ſpirits being collected and heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſee clearly what is in their way.

Wherefore by reaſon of the groſſe moyſture of it, and the ſmall ſpirits, they that are ſo affected ſee not very clearly, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a bright Ayre, which offends them chiefly; But if the humour and ſpirit be of a moderate temper,<note place="margin">Eyes and ſight moderately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</note> the colour is between white and black very clear, and thereby is the ſight performed moſt exactly.

So when children are firſt born, their eyes are grey and blew, Sea-green, green, Owl-eyes, but as age comes on, they grow black; but in old age, they grow white as their hairs do, or degenerate into Owl-like eyes.

For if at any time that ſex, which is ſhaken with the ſmalleſt affections and prints them upon the Child, conceives any thing in the mind; or thinks that things are double before their eyes, by the concourſe and Flux of humours, that fall down on thoſe parts, about which the thoughts are employed, do ſerve to frame double parts that are ſuperfluous, or parts of ſome other kind. For ſuch abſurd imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are obſerved in living Creatures. So lately a Lamb was yeaned, with a Head of a Sea-Calfe, at the ſight of that Sea-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. So the yeare before, there was ſeen, a Sheep and a Calfe, with double Heads: and I ſaw and handled a Hen,<note place="margin">When double things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</note> that had four feet, and four Wings. But ſince Women in conception, and all the time they go with Child, have divers ſpecies and things in their imaginations; and ſometimes it falls out, that double repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things are made to them, from groſſe vapours riſing from beneath, or with diſtracted and broken Spirit, that ſhould be directed to the point of the Apple of the Eye, whereby their ſight is divided and cut into two, all this affection is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Child thats breeding,<note place="margin">What imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can do.</note> and ſome parts being hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely formed, imagination faſtneth to them other needleſſe parts.</p>
                  <p>For the force of imagination is ſo ſtrong, that if a woman once faſten her eyes and thoughts upon any object, all the faculties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that force that ſerves to form the Child, the humours running from all parts, which are at her command, fall down thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and imagination is wholly intent to do the buſineſſe; hence it is that ſomtimes ſhe frames divers and unuſuall ſhapes, double parts, and ſuperfluous appendixes, and faſtneth ſtrange limbs to the body. But from defect of humours and penury of nutriment,<note place="margin">Whence come parts to be wanting.</note> or where the naturall faculties in making the parts are too weak,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53844:138"/>and not forceable enough, it falls out that men want ſome parts, or have them diſproportioned and too ſmall, and though Nature ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have matter enough to make the Child of, and hath force and ſtrength enough to do it, yet ſhe is now and then hindred, that ſhe cannot bring all things to perfection, and frame a comely and well proportioned body;<note place="margin">How hands and feet come to be wanting or maimed.</note> ſo that the Infant is born ſometimes with ſome parts cut ſhort or maimed, and not made up: for ſometime a woman may have a narrow Matrix, a hard and callous Spleen, Hips ſticking forth, and turned inward back again, and other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, that will not ſuffer the Infant to grow, and to be perfect in all parts: for the tender parts of the body by reaſon of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments cannot be dilated, nor diffuſe themſelves, nor enjoy the nouriſhment comes to it; but is ſtopt and ſtay'd, that the parts cannot grow beautifully and well formed.

So I ſaw a noble mans Daughter, with a maimed and ſpongy hand,<note place="margin">A Hiſtory rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> which when the Parents ordered mee to handle her, I found by touching of her fingers, that the joynts, which by nature ſhould come forth, were turned inwards and retorted, ſo that they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented no ſhape of fingers, for all the parts of this member, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſmall bones, wherewith the hands ſhould be clinched or opened, were hid and folded up within.

Moreover that which is purged being flegme, that which purgeth it out muſt be of a flegmatique nature alſo: whereby he ſhews, that between the humour and the medicament there is a ſimilitude and agreement and natural fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, which cannot be aſcribed to the firſt qualities, but to the ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we muſt uſe otherwayes to try the force of herbs that do any thing by the force of their qualities, that is of heat, cold moyſture or dryneſſe, and of ſuch as work upon the body by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of their whole ſubſtance, and a heavenly effect, or ſidereall influence. For thoſe that change the quality of the body, are to be examined by reaſon and judgment,<note place="margin">Reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in arts.</note> but thoſe that purge out the humours, are to be found out by experience and daily uſe. So in the former there muſt be judgment and choice, in the latter expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; whereof the one as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith is difficult, the other falſe and dangerous. So purging medicaments that drive the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours out of the body, or elſe venemous things that are pernicious and dangerous to the body, wherewith ſome Nations go about to deſtroy their Enemies, as others do with the ſword, are to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by uſe and experience, for they do it not by reaſon of heat; otherwiſe, Pepper, or Cardamom would do the like, but by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and native property. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeems to ſubſcribe to this opinion, when he ſaith, Phyſick when it is come into the body,<note place="margin">Lib. de natur. human.</note> it firſt attracts and draws unto it ſelfe, that which is moſt familiar and naturally agreeing with it, and like unto it, then it moves the other humours alſo, and forceth them out.<note place="margin">A ſimile from the Earth and ſeed.</note> For as plants draw to them what is moſt agreeing with them, by a naturall propinquity, and they live by that moyſture, and change it into nutriment; ſo medicaments, appointed to drive forth humours, are carried to their like, and drive them forth either above or beneath. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no man reject it as an old or ridiculous fable,<note place="margin">Cantharides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcerate.</note> that we now ſay; that to every part certaine hearbs are properly appointed: when Spaniſh flyes that are of a corroding quality, if they be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed outwardly to the skin, will hurt no internall parts but the bladder, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, ſo that they are carried through the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and ventricle without doing hurt,<note place="margin">Ad Piſonem.</note> and by the paſſages of the Liver they penetrate to the bladder, and they exulcerate no part but that. So the juyce of black Poppy, and Hemlock hurt the heart and brain; the Sea hare, the Lungs: though all poyſons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be caſt out by vomit, or rebated and kept down by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes, will by degrees come to the heart if they be applyed onely outwardly, which is clear by the biting of a mad dogg, and his ſome that ſticks upon the wound; for by a penetrating force,<note place="margin">Perſons applyed outwardly will come to the Heart.</note> the skin being firſt corroded, the venome flyes to the principall parts, and makes a man mad.

For Cucumbers deſire water, and delight to be very wet therewith, ſo that if they be planted too farr from it, they will creep and go that way: on the otherſide they refuſe Oyle and flye from it, and if they be ſprinkled with it, they grow thin and die.<note place="margin">The Vine loves the Olive.</note> But the Vine loves to grow near the Olive, and will be content to have it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into it, deſiring to joyn with it.<note place="margin">The Oak hates the Olive.</note> But the Oak and Olive Tree are at very great ods, and hate one the other ſo much, that if one touch the boughs of the other, they will grow crooked, and turn to the contrary way;<note place="margin">The Baytree an enemy to the Vine.</note> So the Vine endures not to grow near to the Baytree, becauſe this is ſhady, and by its heat hinders the growing of it.

So ſome plants are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the affinity, and nearneſſe of ſome other Plants, and are refreſhed by the mutual embracements of their boughs and tender ſtalks, others are averſe and withdraw themſelves, and will by no means unite.<note place="margin">Pitch is taken out with Oyl.</note> So ſome things that are roſiny and of a fat ſubſtance, agree well, hence it is that Pitch is waſhed out with Oyl, if the Garments be Silk or Velvet, or Fluwel, or Skarlet, Purple, or Chamlet,<note place="margin">Butter and Oyl take out dirt.</note> or the moſt precious dyes that are ſtayned by it: For all theſe kinds of ſtains and filth are taken off and made clean with butter or Oyl ſo handſomely that it cannot be perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

And hence it is that ſome plants are called the Male,<note place="margin">What plant is the Male, and which the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</note> others the Female: the Females are thoſe that have leſſe force and vertue; and are full of a cold and unfruitfull moyſture; Whence it comes that they will bear flowers in their ſeaſon, but for want of heat, and by reaſon of their debility they bear no fruit, Berries, Kernels, or ſeed.

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53844:146"/>being applyed to the thigh of one that is in labour, it makes a ſpeedy and eaſy delivery, without any difficulty almoſt or ſtreight in bringing forth.

For I think that by their daily familiarity and converſation in the houſe with them, they had found and learned, what a wicked and malitious woman will do, if at any time ſhe be angry or provoked, what Tragedies ſhe will cauſe, and how violently ſhe will rage and ſtorme.

The ſenſe is, it is better to hold commerce with a wicked man, or to deal with him, than to have to do with a deceitfull woman; For though in ſhew, and at firſt appearence ſhe may ſeem to be good, and honorable, and in outward behaviour diſcovers no wickedneſſe, or deceit, yet afterward you ſhall find her inconſtant, falſe, captious, fraudulent, and full of impoſture; ſo that if any man deceive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the fraud and impoſture of a man, is righteouſneſſe, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the wickedneſſe of a woman.

So in the wickedneſſe of opinions, and in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any pernicious ſect, and maintaining it, one man may be more dangerous and more impious than another, that ſome Hereticks may be accounted Orthodox, and to teach the right ſaving truth compared with others;<note place="margin">One man is more wicked than another.</note> that eſtabliſh more abſurd impious blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous execrable doctrines: which is grown to a proverb, This man is a godly and holy man in reſpect of that: as much as to ſay, that though they be both Knaves and ungodly, yet if you would meaſure them both by the rule of equity, and ſquare of Juſtice, one may be accounted innocent, and to be pardoned, in reſpect of the other's wicked enormities.

Amongſt thoſe things that will make ones beard grow,<note place="margin">What cauſeth a beard.</note> and are eaſy to be had, I reckon Honey, freſh Butter without Salt, the juyce of a red Onion, Reed-roots, with joynts to diſtinguiſh them, that have a white colour, and a Honeyed taſte, Badgers greaſe, called <hi>Das,</hi> Bears, Lions, Greaſe, Bryony-roots, Beets, Radiſh, Pepperwort, white Lillies, Flour-de-luce: a liniment may be made of theſe,

But Eunuchs by nature, or ſuch whoſe Teſticles are cut forth,<note place="margin">Why Eunuchs want beards.</note> try all means in vain to make their beards grow, becauſe they want heat, which cannot raiſe the humours; therefore they have a ſmall feminine voice, and ſmooth body though they were hairy before.</p>

                  <head type="sub">To what we ought to aſcribe, amongst ſuch multitudes of men, the great diſsimilitude of forme; and the manifold difference that is between man and man in their faces, countenances, eyes, and other parts, ſo that ſometimes Brothers and Siſters are not one like the other.</head>
                  <p>AS there is in Nature a wonderful &amp; gracious variety, ſo there is the ſame in the form and ſhapes of men, in their colours, contenance, eyes, lineaments, and in their faces there is found an admitable; and numberleſſe diſparity and diſſimilitude.<note place="margin">To What muſt be aſcribed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude in men.</note> Some refer this to the influence of the Starrs, but I think to referr it more properly and rationally to the nature of the Seed; and the Mothers Imagination. For being that the woman in the very conception, and all the time ſhe goes with Child,<note place="margin">The Womans i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination doth many things.</note> even for nine months, hath divers thoughts in her mind, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment is drawn this way, and that way, by thinking on divers things, and her eyes being ſtill fixed upon ſuch objects ſhe lights upon, it falls out that thoſe things ſhe ſees, and are faſteſt rivered in her imagination are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to her Child. For when the Nature of the woman is carefully intent, in framing the Infant, and thinks on nothing but a fair and well proportioned Child, and all her forces are bent thereunto, if any ſhape or Image be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the ſight, this ſoon reflects upon the of-ſpring, who participates of it. Moreover Mothers, ſo ſoon as the Child is born, do the beſt they can that the Child may have a decent, comely, well proportioned body, fitly diſtinguiſhed in all the parts of it.<note place="margin">The faults of Nature may be amended.</note> For Childrens bodies are ductile and pliable, as Clay or Wax, and may be bended any way. Wherefore if the mouth ſtand awry, and is uncomely, they forge frame and order it into a decent poſture; and if the face be frowning and lowring, they will make it pleaſant and amiable, and beautifull: they make the eyes very handſome and lovely; and of gray eyes or blunket, which Infants commonly have by reaſon of moyſture, they make them black by abundantly feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with milk, and chiefly if the Nurſe be of a hot temper, and the Child be kept in a dark place. For a light Chamber, where the Sun ſhines in much, or a great fire, hurts the render eyes. But ſquint rolling gogle eyes, and ſuch as turn the wrong way,<note place="margin">That the balls of the eyes may grow black.</note> are reduced to their right poſture, by bending the ſight the contrary way, for the Muſcles will be brought to their naturall places by wreſting them to the otherſide, and being turned about will come right: they raiſe and ſet eaven the noſtrills that are crooked and fall down, by a gentle way of handling them: but they reduce Eagle noſes and ſuch as are with beck; by preſſing them down to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent figure, that the perpendicular of the noſe may be ſtretched forth from the forehead and eybrows, unto the hollow part in the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53844:154"/>upper-lip, like a gnomon or right line, or ſtyle that ſtands upon Sun Dialls,<note place="margin">What forme of Noſe is comely.</note> neither ſet on bending outward or inward. Likewiſe if the lips be ſwoln or fat, which is uſuall with the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if the noſe that is crooked be preſſed down, they handle theſe artificially, and they often preſſe them that they may grow leſſe, and ſink down lower: by the ſame way they frame into a comely faſhion, a chin that ſticks out, or is drawn in, the forehead, head, cheeks or eybrows that are deformed; and decently order by art, what is not ſeemly. So if nature limp on any part, and is gon off from the beſt forme and proportion,<note place="margin">Whence comes deformity of the body.</note> as ſome have wry necks, crooked gowty ill favourd legs, or bunch backs, that makes them ugly, all theſe errours are eaſily mended in thoſe that are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and ſuch members as are wreſted or disjoynted, or out of their places, are for right by the care and induſtry of man. So the diligent care of Nurſes makes Children grow up handſomely, and ſo are obnoxious to no deformities of their limbs. But the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of many Mothers, and great idleneſſe, makes Children not onely to grow up unhandſomely, and ill favour'dly, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bunch-backr, lame, ſquint eye'd, bull-headed, and not comely to look on, for they are departed from the dignity and excellency that is in man's body. Some Nurſes are over diligent and too officious, who beſtow ſome labour alſo on the Childrens privy parts, that ſerve them them to make water with, and in time ſhall be uſefull for propagation of Children, that they may be ripe betimes, and not fail of hopes of getting Children, and when they come to be marryed they may not be a ſhamed, for ill performing the matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall duty, when they obſerve bitter contentions and quarrels to ariſe amongſt kindred for this very cauſe, that they will threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to divorce their Sons in Law, unleſſe they can ſhew their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and pleaſe their wives the better, yet I uſe to diſlike and diſcommend this effeminate and laſcivious office uſed by Nurſes; for young youths, by reaſon of pulling them thus by their yards, before their time, or that they come to be of age, or have mans ſtrength: they are prone to venery, and ſo conſume thoſe helps, and vent out thoſe humours and vitall ſpirits, wherewith afterwards they might be able to procreate luſty and lively Children; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by unſeaſonable venery,<note place="margin">The diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of untim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly venery.</note> they either get no Children, or if they beget any they are lither, and not ſo long lived. Therefore I think it is good, not to let young people marry too ſoon, untill their forces beſtrong and confirmed, and that they can endure any hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in matrimoniall ſociety, which tender years cannot do, for they will preſently wax faint, and effeminate. It is then better that the ſecret parts ſhould ſwell out of their own accord natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, than that they ſhould be drawn forth by any allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Many kinds of Animals, Fiſhes, Birds, Inſects are bred without Seed, as alſo Pants: and many Animals, and ſmall Birds, by an unuſall way, without the copulation of Male and Female, do conceive.</head>
                  <p>DAily examples ſhew, that many things come forth, and are propagated by nature of their own accord, and withovt any embracings of others or generation, onely from filth &amp; corruption, as Dormice, Rats, Snails, Shell-fiſh, Carterpillers, Graſs-Worms, Waſps, Hornets, Weevils, Froggs, Moths, Toads, Eels.<note place="margin">Many things breed from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> In mens bodies Worms, though theſe have ſeed within them, whereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they propagate abundantly. Alſo many plants grow forth from the muddy moyſture of the earth, and fatneſſe of it, no ſeed being ſowed, or plants ſet in the ground before, as are Darnel, Cockle, Nettles, wild Olives, Weeds, and graſſe that ſpring up of themſelves. Alſo there are ſome Crows in the Low-Countries that conceive by their mouth, which they call Rock Jackdaws,<note place="margin">What Crows couceive by the mouth.</note> becauſe they build in clifts of Rocks, and hollow ſtones, and not in Trees. The Dutch call them commonly <hi>Steen Cawwe,</hi> and theſe do not tread one the other as other birds do, as we uſually ſee in Cocks and other foule, that get upon the backs of the Females, and ſo copulate with them: but theſe look ſtedfaſtly with their eyes, one upon another, never winking, ſo that the Female draws forth dewy drops from the eyes of the Male, by conſtant looking upon him, which ſhe drinks up, and from thence, as ſome think, ſhe conceives. I dare not certainly determine, whether they do bring forth by the mouth, as with us the Cuttle, Shrimps, Calama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Lobſters, the Polypus, and the fiſh Galeus, commonly call'd the Hay, do, with a rough skin, that even in the fiſh-Markets, will caſt forth her young by her mouth.<note place="margin">The fiſh Galens brings forth by her mouth and what others.</note> Of the Hay there is nothing more certain, and commonly known, that ſhe doth caſt forth her young at her mouth: for lately when a Country man had bought ſome Hayes very cheap, and carried them at his back, the Citizens and people that looked on, ſaw ſome of her young ones creeping forth at her mouth; ſo that the Country fellow being laughed at by the common people, and diſdayning thoſe kind of fiſh, threw them all away upon the dunghill. There is alſo another Hay, that is ſmooth, and ſoft skin'd, not rugged, that brings forth her young about her Navell, her belly opening there and breaking, ſo that the young one ſticks faſt to the bowells of the Female, by a long ſtring. I have heard ſome fiſhermen of credit relate, that they had ſeen ſome Hayes newly taken forth of the Male, his mouth gaping; and that he caſt out ſix or ſeven ſmall fiſh by his mouth, that were wonderfull lively, that being immediately caſt into the Sea, would ſwim at firſt; as we ſee Chikens taken forth of their ſhells to pick at any thing; and to ſcratch. But this is admirable, that ſince the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53844:155"/>Hay brings forth at the mouth being open, that young fry ſhould run again often into the dams belly, and the ſecret parts there, and hide themſelves amongſt her bowels; and then they will come forth again to ſport,<note place="margin">Of the induſtry of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> which <hi>Plutarch</hi> wondered at. The Hayes ſaith he, for their fatherly indulgence give place to no living Creatures. Firſt they have egs, then fiſh very many, which they do not put forth as other Creatures do, but hatch them within themſelvs, and theſe they breed up and carry in their bellys, as if it were a ſecond birth; when they grow great, they let them wander at pleaſure, and again receive them in at their mouths, and let them inhabite in their bodies, and there they allow them a place of refuge, and houſe to dwell in, and meat, till they can provide for themſelves, and can ſwim well: and that they may learn this perfectly, they teach them to ſport and to ſwim, alſo to tumble themſelves, and to uſe nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, that they may the ſafer eſcape the danger of Sea-Monſters. In our Seas there are many kinds of Hays, whereof ſome are cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in other arts, diverſly. Amongſt theſe the Hay that is gray colour'd, which the Dutch call Sprink-Hay, becauſe with incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble agility, he will ſpring four Cubits high above the water, and will ſwiftly run from danger, that he may not become a prey to others. Alſo there is a Hay with a ſpotted skin, all full of black marks, we call this <hi>den Gheſpickled</hi> Hay, as we ſee dogs and horſes marked with ſpots: Our <hi>Geſner</hi> deſcribes this by the name of the Rock dog; alſo there is brought into the fiſh market, the Hay call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Centrina</hi> or <hi>Speerhaye,</hi> as if you would call them ſpeered or ſharp Hays; for they have two ſharp prickles on their backs, wherewith they wound men dangerouſly, our Country men keep theſe pricks in ſilver caſes to pick their teeth with. Thus much of fiſh that conceive and bring forth at the mouth, as is well known to our men. But as for the conception of Chows, that is performed by the mouth as it is reported, I dare ſay nothing for certain, yet they ſeem to me to repreſent the Nature of Pigeons that beck one the other, and do as it were kiſſe, as lovers do their Sweet-hearts. Wherefore that proverb of Pigeons is uſed concerning them, who ſport and play, and kiſſe, and cal one the other, and embrace often. The Dutch call this <hi>Duvebecken,</hi>

                  <p>COnſcience, that is the teſtimony of good and bad in every mans mind, which by a remembring of what is done,<note place="margin">What Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is.</note> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves what is praiſe worthy, and condemns what is naught and ill, is by God ſet in every mans heart.

                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.</note> and as the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Their Soul is pierced with the Conſcience of their wicked deeds as with a Sword.</hi> For when they call to mind the miſchief they have done, they preſently tremble, wax pale, look about, and are afraid of the ſafeſt means, as if the furies of hell hurried them along. For there is in every man an imbred choice of things by nature,<note place="margin">What is the Law of nature.</note> a judgment, and diſtinction of good and bad, and the knowledge of God is printed in their Souls, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Law or Inſtinct or conduct of nature,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.</note> whereby we are carried to what is honeſt, and we abhor what is ill, every mans conſcience, as he ſaith, bearing him witneſſe, and their thoughts excuſing or accuſing one another. Wherefore great is the force and vertue of conſcience in all actions of our lives, ſo that a Man, though horrid things be objected againſt him, will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his conſtancy, and will allwaies perſevere in his counſel and reſolution he hath undertaken, and will not fear or tremble, or dread with any threatnings, if he have done nothing amiſſe. But he that is guilty of a crime, and his mind is polluted with it, thinks the puniſhment to be alwaies before his eyes, and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to perſue him continually. For fear, which makes the bloud hide it ſelf, and deads the ſpirits, riſing from the conſcience of ſins, takes away a mans courage,<note place="margin">Conſcience changeth the form of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> and changeth his countenance, and the habit of all his body: ſo that in the midſt of all his jollity, in dancings and banquettings, and in Conjugal embracements, he feels the rack and tortures of Conſcience; whereas integrity of life makes all calm, peaceable, quiet, and no trouble at all: which
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53844:157"/>one thing may be a forcible argument that the mind of man came from God, and is moved by his power,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A</hi> ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</note> and guided by his ſpirit and direction, and that the Soul lives after death, which, when ſome years are paſt, when the Supream Judge ſhall pleaſe to judge the world, ſhall again unite with the body after a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. In the morning early the force and ſting of Conſcience is moſt clear, the fumes and fuliginous vapours being diſcuſſed,<note place="margin">Conſcience, what time of the day it ſhews it ſelf.</note> wherewith the mind from the actions or banquets of the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as from gluttony, drunkenneſſe, revelling, and the like was oppreſſed, ſo that about that time eſpecially the mind recollects what was formerly done, and thinks on ſuch things that ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves or diſlikes. So ſaith the Prophet,<note place="margin">Why the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhews it ſelf in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Pſalm <hi>5.</hi> Eſay <hi>50.26.</hi> Ecclus. <hi>39.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Thou wilt hear my voice in the morning, Oh Lord, in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look; For thou art not a God that hath pleaſure in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Lord ſhall listen unto me in the morning: in the morning will I attend unto thee. The just ſhall deliver his Soul, that he may watch unto God that made him: God, O my God, I watch for thee in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> So then to thoſe that newly wake,<note place="margin">Pſalm <hi>62.</hi>
                     </note> when they have eaten nothing, nor drank, the affects of the mind and Conſcience do moſt repreſent themſelves, and God warneth men early in the morning. For what admoniſhment, or wholeſome Inſtruction can be offered to men when they are drunk with Wine, or crop-ſick with glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony? So I know many men who when the memory of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ill life troubles them often, they preſently drown'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with drink, that they may forget all the wickedneſſe they have committed, and that the remembrance thereof may not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſteal upon them: yet the next day the miſchief became raw and did more cruelly torment their minds. For the like hapneth to theſe men, as it doth to men that are diſeaſed,<note place="margin">A ſimile from ſick men.</note> who will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe but conceal the Ulcers and ſores they have about them, whereby they are more bitterly tortured inwardly; to which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> alludes, when he ſaith;<note place="margin">Pſalm <hi>31.</hi> The place of the Pſalmiſt explain'd.</note> 
                     <hi>When I kept ſilence my bones waxed old through wy roaring all the day long.</hi> The ſin and terrour of his Soul, and unquietneſſe of his mind, and preſſures of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, did ſo drive him to confeſſe his wickedneſſe, and yet he could not be drawn to confeſſe his ſin, and to purge it away by true repentance. But the regulating of mans life by inſtitution, the habit of his body,<note place="margin">Who want Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> and imbred humours are of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in moving the mind, and in raiſing, or ſtilling the motions of Conſcience. So Marriners, Souldiers, Porters, Carriers, Huck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Victuallers, Hoſts, Bankers, Uſurers, Bauds, and many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and petty Merchants, Brokers, Shopkeepers, and Tradeſmen, are not much moved with any motion of conſcience, that they have made it large enough, and it is become like wide nets that let all things through, ſtraining at a Gnat, as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, and ſwallowing down a Camell.<note place="margin">A ſimile from Nets. Math. <hi>23.</hi>
                     </note> Others that are addicted to a ſolitary and melancholique life, are too much troubled about it, and tremble for fear, when there is no cauſe of fear. So the force of Conſcience drives ſuperſtitious people farther than they ought
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53844:158"/>to go, and they will not be quit of their vain perſwaſions. So melancholique people are more anxious than other men, but cholerique people by reaſon of the thinneſſe of humours and heat, make no regard of conſcience, and they either caſt it off, or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate it, or ſtrive to forget it. Sanguine people are not much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with any ſuch motion in their ſouls, nor do they ever think of their life paſt:<note place="margin">

                        <hi>'Jobes</hi> place is explained.</note> For thoſe things that we did inſolently in our youth, and were not much perplexed with them, the ſame will in times of diſeaſes calamities danger or old age,<note place="margin">An clegant ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile from ſuch as are oppreſſed by uſury.</note> come freſh to our memory, like to accounts that are croſſed and blotted out. Like to thoſe that have borrowed great ſums of other mens moneys, and have quite forgotten to pay, are called upon for it, and compelled by Law to make all good. But Phlegmatique people, are ſlow, ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, forgetfull, careleſſe, nor do they ever think what conſcience is, nor doth their mind ever wax hot, or can they be ſtirred up by any meanes to think of goodneſſe, as being drown'd in too much moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.

                        <hi>Eccle.</hi> 11.</note> they frame all their thoughts rather by the rule of pleaſure than the ſquare of moderation. Whence <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks to the purpoſe,<note place="margin">Youth void of counſell.</note> Youth is vain, raſh, ſlippery, inconſtant, mad,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53844:158"/>thoughtleſſe, improvident, inconſiderate, and the pleaſures that uſe to accompany it, are tranſitory and ſoon gon; ſometimes they are damnable, and have a lamentable and miſerable event. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe commonly the companions of this age, are ignorance, want of experience, want of counſell, inconſideration, therefore it leſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends what is good for it, and may make it proſperous. Alſo ſome there are, that are at their full age, &amp; who have the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commonwealth, and are to take care for the Church and Religion, whoſe conſciences are blinded with errour and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that oft times they do not meaſure all things out exactly, and by rule, or call reaſon into Counſell,<note place="margin">Men are not led by conſcience but by their paſſions.</note> with Judgment and election of things, or performe what they do by the right rule of Gods Word and Spirit; but oft times either humane paſſions drive them, or elſe the favour and gratifying of Princes prevails with them, which we read that <hi>Paul</hi> did: or elſe ſome errour of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſome inveterate ſuperſtition, or an old vitious cuſtome that is crept in, not by the conſent and authority of good men, but by the miſunderſtanding of the ignorant common people,<note place="margin">Old errours are hardly left.</note> yet as if it were a rule for men to walk by, no man will ſuffer to be taken away, or aboliſhed, whence it comes to paſſe, that in the choice of things, in the difference of good and bad, in ſetting up, and reſtoring, and propagating true Religion and the worſhip of God, they are blind and deceived, and wander from the truth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John.</hi> 16.</note> to the great detriment of conſcience. So the Jews were perſwaded that they did God good ſervice, when they raged againſt thoſe that had given up their names unto Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtirred up with the ſame violence, and deſire to puniſh the Chriſtians, and he perſecuted them fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.</note> with a zeal of godlineſſe, but which was wrapt up in errour, and, as he ſaith being an Apoſtle, was not according to knowledge,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> that is, it was not done with judgment, or reaſon, and with a right unſtanding of the cauſe, as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> did,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 5.</note> not firſt knowing and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving what the will of God is, not by the inſtigation and inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the the ſpirit of God, which he will have to be tried and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the expreſſe word of God,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.</note> whether it proceed from thence: Wherefore there is errour committed in the choice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, not by an affection and propenſion to godlineſſe, becauſe they wanted the Spirit of God, who puts into mens minds, things that are certain, and out of all doubt. So the wiſe man ſaith, There is a way ſeems good unto a man, but the laſt end thereof,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.</note> tends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews us an example of it, who of a perſecutour was made a Preacher, and a defender and maintainer of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt; who profeſſeth that he obtained mercy,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.</note> becauſe he did it ignorantly through unbeleife, and that thereby, in him Chriſt Jeſus had ſhew'd all clemency, to be an example to thoſe that ſhould believe in him unto eternall life. Some perchance may ſay that I have uſed too many words in treating of the motions of conſcience, becauſe this argument be longs to Preachers and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of Divinity, whoſe duty it is, and by vertue of their office, they are bound to pacifie and ſettle mens conſciences, and to free
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53844:159"/>them from all feares. But ſince theſe affections do overthrow mans health, that proceed from the ſtings of conſcience, and the Spirits and humours vitiated, do afford nutriments for it: it is the Phyſitians part alſo to remove theſe perturbations out of mens minds, that, thoſe being taken away, the body may be in perfect health. For it it a laborious and very difficult matter to reſtore the body that is fallen ſick, where the conſcience is polluted with the ſpots of ſinns, where the Organs of the ſenſes, and the Spirits vitall and animall are vitiated. And it is no leſſe troubleſome, for a Church-man to give comfort to the ſoul, when the body is full of vitious humours: for by reaſon of the narrow conſent and union of both parts, the vices of the mind fly upon the body, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the body,<note place="margin">The ſympathy of the Soul and body.</note> are carryed to the Soul. As we have for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all mad people, and ſuch as are melancolique or frantique, ſuch as rave or dote, or are drunk, Apoplectick, paralytick, forger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſtupid, Lunatick, and many more, whoſe ſick diſtempers proceed from the diſtemper of the brain; wherefore we muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look to the head, which is the ſeat of the mind, and uſe all meanes to preſerve both parts in health.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their opinion is fooliſh and of no moment, who think that a Child at ſeven months is imperfect, and not ſo long lived, and that a Child cannot be borne perfect in all parts untill nine months be paſt. So of late, there aroſe a great conflict amongſt us,<note place="margin">A Hiſtory of a Child born.</note> and it was cruell and bloody, and a moſt deadly and deſperate fight, by reaſon of a Maid, whoſe chaſtity was violated, that had no ill Name or doubtfull report, but ſhe had a weak head, and a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment; and theſe of all others are ſooneſt overcome, and do not ſo valiantly and corragiouſly reſiſt and ſtand againſt either threats of flattering inticements, other wiſe than ſome fierce clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous maids uſe to do, who will bite and ſcratch, and compell one that ſhall aſſault their chaſtity to forſake them. But in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy the conflict grew again more violent and bitter, becauſe the Father, who was reported to have gotten her with Child, or to have raviſhed her, denyed the fact, which his enemies charged upon him, ſo bitterly, that he might be torturd, and racked till he ſhould confeſſe it, but he confidently avouched,<note place="margin">A deniall of a rape charged upon one.</note> that he was ready to forſwear it upon the Bible, (he himſelfe being wont to be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, in judgment, and to handle ſacred matters, (that he never ſo much as entred her, or broke the membrane of her Virginity, nor penetrated into her body. Wherefore he would by no means be taken for the Father of the Child, or that it ſhould be accounted his: amongſt other arguments he alleaged for his innocency, this was one, that the Child was born in the 7th, month, and hardly ſo late; for the month was rather then new begun, than ended, and all the parts of it were perfect, except the nails, which we obſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be wanting in a Child born in nine months, eſpecially where great bellyed women uſe ſalt fiſh too laviſhly, or lick ſalt, as that ſex is moſt prone to deſire ſalt and ſharp things.<note place="margin">When a Child wants nails.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſtrove to prove it was not a Child of ſeven months, but nine months, and that by making that account of the months, and by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the reaſon of time, they muſt ſeek for another Father, who had formerly lain with her, and got her with Child.

But when ſhe begins to ſhew her ſelfe, and is new, and when ſhe is full, that is, ſhe is in oppoſition to the Sun, and ſhews round, ſhe hath wonderfull force in conception and many other things: for ſhe both augments Corn and fruits, and ſhell-fiſh, and fleſh that hangs to the roofs of houſes, is corrupted by the beams of it ſhining upon it, &amp; ſuch as ſleep or continue long in the Moon light, ſhe makes pale, and trembling, and heavy headed, brings the Epilepſe to Children, as alſo ſtupidneſſe, and the Palſey, and many more things ſhe doth, not that ſhe exceeds the other Planets, but ſhe doth it by being ſo neere to us. For ſhe being ſo placed in the loweſt Orb,<note place="margin">The Moon is a Planet next the Earth.</note> and next to the earth, ſhe doth ſo guide the beginnings, and increaſe of things, that by the effect of her, even after conception of the ſeed, the Child in the Mothers Womb, by the Mothers blood that nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, is augmented and made to grow.<note place="margin">The time of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the Infant is to be referred to the courſe of the Moon.</note> Alſo all the time a woman goes with Child, whether you pleaſe to meaſure it by dayes or months or weeks, as great bellyed women commonly uſe to reckon, muſt be referred and counted by the age of the Moon. But ſhe ſhews her forces more effectually upon the body, either when firſt ſhe meets with the Sun, &amp; begins to be enlightned by him, or when ſhe is round and full, but when ſhe is but a halfe Moon, ſhe hath leſſe forces, and leaſt of all when ſhe is crooked, and by degrees fades and is obſcured. For at that time there is no concourſe of waters in the Ocean, no abundance of humours in the bodies of men, no collection of marrow in the bones, ſo that then it is fit for tender bodies to leave off copulation, and to make a League with it. But I oft times uſe to foretell to women great with Child when their travel ſhall be eaſie,<note place="margin">When the birth will be eaſie.</note> and ſo to raiſe their minds to hope very well if they chance to travel when the Moon is either new or full,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53844:161"/>eſpecially when the force of the Moon is about the Secrets, or Groins, or Thighs; for I ſaid elſewhere that this Planet runs through all the parts, and ſtays upon them ſeverally two dayes, and ſometimes three. And when ſhe ſtays about thoſe parts, the Womb is wet and ſlippery and opens with more eaſe, and is dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and makes the paſſage ready for the child to come well out by. But if the birth happen when the Moon is old, and diminiſhed, it commonly uſeth to be more laborious, and to be thruſt forth with great ſtrugling and endeavours. Becauſe I have often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved theſe things, and they ſeem not ſtrange from reaſon, I thought fit to ſet them down to make good this argument. Moreover ſince we have in ſome part mentioned the Moons forces, it is fit to remember this again, that I ſpake of a little before, that in rayſing and changing of the temper of the Ayre, ſhe hath no forces, unleſſe the Sun enlighten her, and that vaſt Planet ſhall ſhine upon her, and illuſtrate her with his face toward her: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that ſhe hath ſo little force, when ſhe firſt comes to meet the Sun, but after the third or fourth day that ſhe ſhines, ſhe manifeſtly foreſhews either a Tempeſt or fair weather,<note place="margin">Prognoſticks from the Moon.</note> ſo that the fourth day conſtitutes the temper or diſtemper of the whole Moneth.</p>

                  <p>SInce many do erre and are blind in the knowledge of naturall things, and eſpecially in thoſe things that appertain to the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of mans body, and many trifling narrations are uſed to be delivered concerning the faſhioning of the Infant, and the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, of the time of a womans going with child, and of the courſe of the Moon; and whether the ſeventh Moneth may be thought ſeaſonable for the birth of a child, and whether a child then born be long lived; I think I ſhall do well if I ſhall attempt by the way to explain the framing of man, for there is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtructure of this divine workmanſhip, and there is an elegant and curious frame of all the parts that are ſeen outwardly, or are inwardly concealed, and ſerve for mans uſe.</p>

But there is a forming faculty and vertue in the Seed, from a divine and heavenly gift, for it is abundantly endued with a vital and etherial ſpirit, and is full of it, and this gives the ſhape and form to the child; ſo that all the parts, and the whole bulk of the body, that is made up in the ſpace of ſo many Moneths and is by degrees framed into a decent and comely figure of a Man, do conſiſt in that, and are adumbrated thereby,<note place="margin">

Phyſitians that have narrowly contemplated mans nature,<note place="margin">Four times of forming the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.</note> conſtitute four different times wherein the framing of man is perfected.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, when preſently after copulation and mutual embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it hath the nature of Seed, at which time it is called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or geniture; becauſe the two Seeds fermented together, do grow up like Creme, or the concretion of Milk;<note place="margin">

                  <p>The ſecond time of forming is conſtituted when Nature and the force of the Womb by the uſe of her own imbred forces and vertue, makes a manifeſt change in the Seed, ſo that all the ſubſtance ſeems rather to be neſhy and ſanguine than ſeminal, and this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens about the 12. or 14. day after the frame began, and though this concretion and fleſhy maſſe, abounds with hot fiery bloud, yet it is rude and without any form, and there are no lineaments or figure of the parts diſtinguiſhed, for the Limbs have yet obtained no certain form; whence it is that we can ſee no faſhion or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53844:162"/>of a man, but onely a rudiment and beginning of mans workmanſhip,<note place="margin">Similitudes from Artificers.</note> that learns as it were to faſhion the child. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may be fetched from Potters, (for Art imitates nature) who from moiſt tenacious tractable Clay, make Images and Pots, firſt without any certain form, undigeſted, but afterwards very artificial figures.<note place="margin">A ſimile from Painters.</note> We may obſerve the ſame in Painters, who firſt with a more rude penſil, or with a cole or chalk draw a picture in the ground-work of it, the Dutch call that <hi>bewerpen,</hi> then they poliſh it and finiſh it; ſo that thoſe things that before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared rough, hid, undreſſed, dark, obſcure, ſhadowed, do after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhew neat, pleaſant, and clear. We may conceive the like in Image-makers and Silver-ſmiths,<note place="margin">A ſimile from Image-makers.</note> who hew their braſſe or wood to poliſh it, and when they have made it hollow with a tool, they poliſh it with another Inſtrument, and ſo they make their work exact and perfect.

But to proceed in relating the other parts of what I have undertaken.</p>
                  <p>The third time to make up this fabrick is ſet, when thoſe three principal parts ſhew themſelves evidently and perſpicuouſly, namely the Heart, from whence ſpring the Arteries; the Brain, from whence, as ſome threads from a diſtaff, the Nerves proceed; and the Liver, from whence the Veins are propagated. To frame theſe the faculty of the Womb is buſied from the time of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto the 18. day of the firſt Moneth.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, which time reacheth to the 28. or 30. day, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts are ſeen exquiſitely elaborated and diſtinguiſhed by their joynts; and then the child begins to grow and to pant; from which progreſſe of dayes, becauſe all the Limbs are parted, and the whole artifice is perfect, it is no longer ſeen as an imperfect child or Embryo, that is, a concretion that ſprings forth, but is held to be a perfect and abſolute child.

At which time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his hair and nails come forth, and the child begins to ſtir and kick in the Womb, ſo that great bellied Women can plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the motion of them, and are troubled with nauſeating and

I knew ſome that longed for live Eels, and Congers, and rent them with their teeth in pieces, and ſwallowed them down. Yet there are many Noble women that are not ſubject to this enormous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and deſire; for that they have not much excrementitions or faulty humours heaped up in their bodies, but it is otherwiſe with the common people; for thoſe women are ravenous, and have heaped up much filthy and feculent humours, and blood in their containing veſſels within, from whence about the third Moneth after conception proceed nauſeating, loathing, ſowre belchings, and the preternatural deſire and coveting of many things is ſtirred up in them.

When both theſe children panted, and appeared to be alive, they were brought to the font to be Baptized, when that was ended, they appeared no longer to be alive.<note place="margin">The ſcituation of the child in the Womb.</note> Moreover I ſhall ſhew by the way how the child lyeth ſcituate in the Womb. It is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Mothers Womb, faſtned with a long ſtring to her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as the Apple is faſt to the Tree by its ſtalk, by which, by the help of the umoilical Vein, it is nouriſhed and drinks at a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of pure bloud; not by the mouth and lips; which are of no uſe yet for to eat by, as the Arſe and Bladder, ſerve not yet to caſt forth the excrements by. For the umbilical vein ſpringing from the Matrix, enters the Liver, in two parts, and is terminated in <hi>vena porta,</hi> from which the moſt pure bloud by the ſeminary veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels is derived to the Matrix. Hence it is that the bloud and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits like auxiliaries and a ſupply of more forces, are alwaies car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried downwards, that none of theſe may be wanting. Wherefore by theſe channells and rivers of Veins and Arteries, that, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Mothers body, are carried to the Womb; and then are preſently faſtned in the Navel, is the child fed; and, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſeed that is foſtered by the heat of the Womb, and is moiſtned with bloud, is it perfected in ſuch a time in all its parts. But the Infant is equally ballanced in the middle of the Womb, as it were in the Center of it, lying all of an heap, and being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing long is turned round, ſo that the head a little inclines, and he layes his chin on his breſt, his heels and ankles upon his buttocks, his hands on his cheeks and eyes, but his legs and Thighs are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed upwards with his hams bending, and they touch the bottom of his belly, the former and that part of the body that is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt us, as the Fore-head, Noſe, Face, is turned toward the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53844:163"/>back, and the head inclining downwards, it hath its eyes and face toward the Coccyx, that is, the rump bone, that is faſt to <hi>os ſacrum;</hi> the Dutch call it <hi>deſtier:</hi> this, in the birth, parts together with the <hi>os pubis,</hi> and is looſned; whence it is that commonly males come with their faces downwards, or with their head turned ſomewhat obliquely, that their faces may be ſeen, but Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males are commonly ſcituate the contrary way, ſo that they come forth with their faces upwards, and look up toward heaven and cry.<note place="margin">Births contrary to Nature.</note> But theſe things do not alwaies proceed according to natures order, for many births are contrary to nature; and many children there are, not born with their heads foremoſt, and their bodies longwayes, and with their hands lying on their hips, but ſome come to the door with their feet, crooked and wide; ſome with their necks bowed, and their heads lying obliquely, with their hands ſtretched out, as they have that ſwim, and with their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders downwards, with great danger to themſelves and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and no leſſe trouble to the Midwives. But when all things proceed orderly and naturally, the child when the time is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the Womb, endeavours to come forth, and inclining himſelf, roles downwards. For he can no longer lye hid in theſe hiding places; than he can find nutriment by the Navel, and the heat of the heart can ſubſiſt without external reſpiration. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being grown great, he is deſirous of nutriment, and of light, and he ſo deſires to take Ayre,<note place="margin">Whence comes pain in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth.</note> that he breaks the Membranes and coverings, wherewith he was covered, and fenced againſt any attrition, and with bitter pangs of his mother he comes forth to the light, and that not onely from the narrow, and ſtraight paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Womb, but becauſe this miſery, and pain in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, was brought in by God,<note place="margin">

                  <p>SInce contagious diſeaſes infect all that come in the way of them yet they infect no men ſooner, than ſuch whoſe Natures are of much affinity one with another; as are Parents and Children, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Brothers, Couſins, who are in danger, almoſt on all hand, and the diſeaſe ſpreads amongſt them. And the nearer any man is of bloud and kindred, the ſooner he catcheth this miſchief from others, by reaſon of Sympathy, that is, conſanguinity and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in humours and ſpirits.<note place="margin">Kindred ſooneſt infected.</note> Wherefore when the Plague is hot, and contagious diſeaſes rage, I uſe to ſpeak to people of one blood, to ſtay one from another, and live ſomething farther from them, leaſt the peſtilent Ayre ſhould infect them, that will ſooner lay hold of acquaintance and kindred, than ſtrangers, and ſuch as are not allyed,<note place="margin">Nurſes infect children.</note> though none be free from danger. The ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſerves for Nurſes, and children ſucking at their breſts; for when the Nurſe is ſick, all the force of the diſeaſe comes to the child, and the Nurſe is helped by it, and eſcapes the danger. For the force of the diſeaſe being diffuſed through the veins that are the receptacles of bloud (and milk uſeth to be made exactly from bloud) the child draws forth the worſt and impure aliment, whence it falls out that the whole force of the diſeaſe reſts upon
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53844:166"/>the child, becauſe the bloud which is the ſubſtance of the Milk, is infected, and tainted with a feavouriſh quality. Wherefore they muſt be preſently weaned that they ſuck not in the diſeaſe, and be polluted with the vicious juice.<note place="margin">Sick children infect the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> Alſo Nurſes ſometimes take diſeaſes from ſucking children, but they are not ſo dangerous, becauſe there proceeds not ſo great force of the Malignity or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion from children, as from Nurſes, whoſe bloud is hotter, and more corrupt.</p>
                  <p>But in curing diſeaſes in children, (becauſe that age cannot away with Phyſick) I uſe this ſtratagem, that I give the Poyſick to the Nurſes, to drink, for the force of the Phyſick ſoon runs through the bloud that the milk is made of, comes into the Breſts, and the Milk receives the quality of it: ſo if it be a purging medicament, it will purge the child; if it be aſtringent, it will ſtop and bind him. Likewiſe if they be naturally ſubject to a Cough, or Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, I give ſuch things as may dilate and cleanſe the breſt, as Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fop, Horehound, Orris root, Elecampane, Licoris, Figs, Savory. Sometimes I command to bind up in a fine rag, ſuch Medicaments as are proper for the child, and to give the infuſion of them, as it is commonly called, eſpecially where that age hath learned to drink, and can put the cup to the mouth; wherefore I ſtudy to find an art how to handle young children, old men, childing-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſuch as lye in, ſick people, and ſuch as are in labour with child, as the condition of every body requires, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſeaſe, having allwaies in my mind that ſaying of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> we muſt yeeld much to age, to the climate,<note place="margin">

And as Marriners as the weather ſerves and the wind, ſometimes fold in their ſheets, ſometimes hoiſe up their ſails, and make all they can, and turn the Rudder now this way, now that way: as Shoomakers fit our feet with Shooes,<note place="margin">Some ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things.</note> Taylors make our clothes fit for our bodies, as Nurſes give children meat chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they are very young, and do not cram them with ſolid meat: as Maſters deal with Schollers according to their age and wit, and firſt teach them their letters, then ſolid learning. As we read Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was very carefull to do in delivering the myſteries of our faith, and in teaching the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> who being not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of more ſublime doctrine, he fed yet, as children with milk, that is, he let fall his words according to their capacities: ſo a skillfull and experienced Phyſitian, handles every man according to his diſpoſition, and gives ſuch things as may profit and do no hurt at all.</p>
                  <p>By theſe reaſons and examples I uſe to ſtop the mouthes of ſome young ſmatterers in learning, who will let no Phyſick be given to Children, old men, child-bearing women, and to ſuch as are weak by travel in child-birth, of which there are none but muſt be ſtrengthened with the greateſt care, and a very convenient diet, and, by a wholeſome uſe of Phyſick, that can do no hurt, be brought to their former health. So I doubt not within three dayes after

                  <p>Alſo about Women with child, if at any time they are infected with an acute diſeaſe, great conſideration muſt be had, leaſt the woman or the child ſhould be endangered. If there be neceſſity to open a vein or purge,<note place="margin">

Alſo to young men infected with the Plague, or taken with an acute diſeaſe, I ſoon apply ſafe remedies, and I do all I can to defend the heart, the fountain of life, and to drive the diſeaſe from the principal parts.</p>
                  <p>Moreover in theſe tender bodies the forces muſt be carefully maintained, and the diſeaſe muſt be vanquiſhed. For it is ill Phyſick where nature ſuffers any loſſe. Wherefore let the Phyſitian either do good, or elſe let him do no harm, but let him ſtudy by Art to profit all he can; and this he ſhall well do, if he do all by right reaſon, and rules of Art.</p>

                  <p>SInce there are many things that laid on outwardly will ſtrengthen the ſtomach, and help concoction, nothing is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or more preſent than a Vultures skin pulled off,<note place="margin">The Nature of the Vulture.</note> being dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and fitted as other skins are; This Bird like the Kite is very greedy, and will eat exceedingly, that the Dutch call this from its deſire of Carrion, and becauſe it is alwaies hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and hunting after its prey, <hi>Ghier,</hi> from the nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they call covetous people, and ſuch as are never ſatisfied; <hi>Ghierich,</hi> that is Vulture-like. But ſince the nature of this bird is ſuch, that it greedily ſeeks after all things, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes all without any hurt to it, the skin of it is of that force, that it will corroborate mans ſtomach, and will ſtrengthen a weak digeſtion, to deſire and concoct the meat, and it will ſtop fluxes of the belly and vomiting, but applyed to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach the contrary way. For I know this by experience, that if one take of the skin of this Bird, and let the ſame be dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53844:167"/>by the Skinners Art handſomely, and fitted, if it be laid to a feeble ſtomach, or belly, it will ſtop the flux of it, and help the ſlipperineſſe of the Inteſtines, eſpecially if it be ſo applyed, that the feathers may be downwards: as we uſe in Garments that are held up, to ſtroke the skins with the hayre, with our hands. For it comforts and cheriſheth one by its warmth and heat, and by its aſtriction, it corroborates the faculties of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral forces, wherewith nutriments uſe to be attracted, retained, concocted, and expelled; alſo it effects that the three nervous tunicles of the ſtomach, and ſo many fibres, the right ones, as <hi>Galen</hi> will have it, whoſe office is to attract, the oblique, that have the retentive faculty, the tranſverſe that thruſt all things out, ſhall do their offices.</p>
                  <p>But that skin applyed the contrary way, with the feathers pointing upwards, and looking aloft, will ſtay vomiting, the Muſcles of the ſtomach being drawn downwards, whereby it takes in, and holds the meat. And in theſe kind of diſeaſes wherewith the upper or nether parts uſe to be affected, I practiſe ſomething not unlike to this. For in vomiting I bid that the mouth of the Stomach ſhall be annointed, ſtroking the hand downwards toward the Navel; but when there is a flux of the belly, to ſtroke it with the hand upward from the feet: and I uſe to do the like if the woman be ſubject to the fits of the Mother. So, as they call it, in the ſtrangling of the Womb, whereby a woman ſeems to be choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the vapours flying upwards, I either command to open a Vein about her Ankles, or cupping glaſſes to be faſtened to her Hips, and I am carefull that all things may be carryed down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, either by caſting in a Clyſter, or by putting up ſuppoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into the Fundament, as they ordinarily call them. But in the falling out of the Womb, where all things are carried downwards, as if the frame of the body were diſſolved, I bid bind the upper parts with Ligaments, ſet Cupping glaſſes to the Breaſts, or to open a Vein in the Arms to make revulſion the contrary way.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in the affects now mentioned things may be given inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according as the diſeaſe requires. So for a flaggy nauſeating ſtomach, or where one cannot well eat his meat, or, when he hath eaten, can hardly digeſt it, beſides good ſtrong heating Wines, as Sack, and Wine of <hi>Crete,</hi> the ſucculent root of Ginger, candyed with Sugar, the Dutch call it <hi>Groen Gingiber gheconfyt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Effects of Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> is an excellent remedy to help concoction, and diſcuſſes winds and crudities contracted from flegmatique humours. Wherefore it clears the dark ſight, that proceeds from groſſe humours that ariſe from the ſtomach to the head. I preſcribe this to ſome people in their meats and ſawces, eſpecially to ſuch that have moyſt watry ſtomachs.</p>
                  <p>To others who by drinking too much Ale or Beer, have a pain or heavineſſe in their ſtomach, and break wind upwards often, I
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53844:168"/>bid them eat ſome pieces of it with a little ſalt, for it can ſcarſe be ſaid how much this will break wind, and eaſe the pains. This root indeed at firſt taſte, burns and bites the tongue, but it cauſeth no thirſt,<note place="margin">Ginger makes not a man thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</note> but by drawing the ſpittle and watry humour from all parts, as from the Head, Throat, Stomach, it keeps the Tongue moyſt, and allwaies wet, and thence it is that no thirſt or drineſſe is found in the mouth.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction doth for man.</note>IT is of much concernment to be bred as we ſhould be. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo ſoon as children are capable to learn, and apt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the ſtudy of Letters, they muſt be taught in time libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ingenious Arts. For by theſe chiefly is the nature of man faſhioned to honeſty, and is cultivated with humanity. The moſt fortunate beginning of Inſtruction is taken from the framing of mens manners. Wherefore let a young man that is deſtinated to be a Scholler firſt learn good Manners, next to that Eloquence and grace of ſpeech, which is ill conceived, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">In Epiſtol.</note> without good manners. For it is better to live Honeſtly than to ſpeak Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; though theſe two ought ſtill to go together, and never to be parted, for one is a great help to the other. Likewiſe we muſt conſider concerning the choice and judgment of things and words,<note place="margin">We muſt learn things and words.</note> for though it be more to be deſired to know things than words, yet things muſt be explained by fit terms and names. Alſo the precepts of life which adorn the mind, and inform the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in piety, though they be honeſt and ſafe of themſelves, yet, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> ſuppoſed, they are more powerfull to perſwade, as oft as clearneſſe of ſpeech is a light to the beauty of things. For thoſe things enter mens minds moſt effectually, that carry their force with them, and are illuſtrated by Rhetorique.<note place="margin">

But if there be neat trim words without wiſdome,<note place="margin">We muſt avoid Barbariſme.</note> and there be no grave ſentences amongſt them, Wiſdome without Eloquence is more to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, than a vain and fooliſh babbling. For, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> de Oratere</note> Wiſdome is the foundation of Eloquence, and of other things. <hi>Horace</hi> ſpeaks wittily, which ſpeech all ought to practiſe.</p>

               <p>But the holy Scripture that proceeded from the Inſpiration of Gods Spirit needs no humane ſupplies. For that affects our minds not by Eloquence and curioſity of words, but by a ſecret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den force draws, and transforms the minds of men, which thing when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would have it known to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>

Wherefore the Apoſtle ſpeaks Wiſdome amongſt ſuch as are perfect, yet not the Wiſdome of this world, or of the Princes of this world, that is of Orators, which ſhall be aboliſhed, and the ſmoaks and vapours of whoſe Oratory ſhall vaniſh, but he ſpeaks the Wiſdome of God in a hidden myſtery, which works more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually upon the minds of men, and makes deeper impreſſion, than any humane learning, ſet forth and adorned with the moſt Elegant words.<note place="margin">Heb. <hi>4.</hi> The word of God is fiery.</note> For the word of God is quick and lively, as he ſaith, and more piercing than any two edged Sword, penetrating into mens Souls and ſpirits, and dividing between the joynts and the Marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts, and of the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart.</p>

Wherefore to what courſe of life ſoever, you addict your ſelf, and whatſoever ſtudy you take upon you, in which you think to continue allwaies, be ſure to exerciſe your ſelf in the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and in his Word,<note place="margin">Let youth be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the beſt things.</note> and from your youth embrace this ſaving knowledge.

Hence <hi>Ieremias</hi> ſpeaks wholeſome words.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lament.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>It is good for a man to bear the yoke of the Lord from his youth.</hi> For a young man as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, will not forſake that way in his age,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">A <hi>ſentence of</hi> Cyprian.</note> That is not ſuddenly and quickly left, that is an old cuſtome, and is grown up with us: for what we uſed from our infancy can hardly be ſhaken of in our age.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that from ancient cuſtome, there are ſo many drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, laſcivious, wanton old men, that, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Job <hi>20.

So <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks in his Oration for <hi>Caelius.</hi> There were in our and our Fore-fathers memories, many excellent and moſt famous men, who when the luſts of their youth were over, became moſt rare men for their vertues in their elder years.

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53844:173"/>good life, by deteſting their vices. Wherefore it is beſt, ſetting all delay aſide to employ our labour to rectify our lives, and from our young years rather to accuſtome our ſelves to what is beſt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to defer the occaſion of it till we grow old.

For all Arts wherein Mans Induſtry is exerciſed, muſt be referred to this, and directed to this end. The profeſſours of worldly Wiſedome did not obtain this: who wandring from the truth thruſt into mens minds things falſe for true, vain for ſolid, faigned for true, doubtfull for certain, hurtfull for ſafe; becauſe they wanted divine inſpiration.</p>

Theology, that is, the knowledge of divine things,<note place="margin">Uſe of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note> delivered by inſpiration from God, informs the mind with godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſhews the manner God muſt be worſhipped, and how every man muſt obtain his falvation.

For the body being
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53844:177"/>in a ſound condition can better ſerve the Soul, and hinders not, nor burdens the mind when it is employed in the contemplation of high things.</p>
               <p>But in the firſt place we ought to take care for out mind, and to adorn that, which is no way better performed, than by a firm and ſtable confidence in God, which raiſeth a man into a moſt certain hope of immortality, and takes out of our minds all dread and fear of death. And as meat is nutriment for the body:<note place="margin">The Souls food.</note> ſo is Gods word the food and nouriſhment of our Souls, whereby alone we conceive peace and tranquillity in our minds, than which there is nothing more to be deſired and ſought for in this life.

Of this kind is the Ayre that is about us, meats and drinks, ſleeping and waking, repletion and inanition, affections and motions of the mind; all of which mans body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53844:178"/>for the preſervation and defence thereof. But becauſe the principal part of health conſiſts in a ſound diet, we muſt diligently obſerve in that, what is good or hurtfull to the body. And ſince gluttony is no leſſe loathſome, than it is pernicious and hurtfull to the body, we muſt take in ſo much meat and drink, as will ſerve natures neceſſity, and that the forces of the body may be fed and not oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Moderate diet is profitable for ſtudents.</note>Moderate diet is profitable and neceſſary in all occupations of ſtudy, and managing of great affairs, to endure watchings in labour, and in performing publick duties. For it is this that keeps health perfect, it makes the ſpirits both animal and vitall that are aſcribed to the brain and heart, to be cheerfull and ready, ſo that what a man conceives in his mind he can readily effect and bring to paſſe without any trouble.</p>
               <p>But daily examples prove that by luxury and intemperance of life, diſeaſes are brought on, our ſtudies are hindred, all honeſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations fail, we cannot proceed in our lucubrations, the cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the mind flags, the vigour of the Soul is extinguiſhed, and men grow dull, idle, lither, ſleepy, and do not endeavour themſelves to perform any great matters. Wherefore, who ſo addicts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Scholler, and to learn books; he muſt ſo moderate his buſineſſe that he do nothing after the will of his appetite, but his appetite muſt be ſubject to reaſon, and he muſt refer all things to the uſe of life,<note place="margin">Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands frugality Luk. <hi>21.</hi>

For whether it be that a man change a ſolitary life for to be converſant amongſt many people, or poverty be changed into plenty of all things, the mind will be never the more quiet, becauſe it doth not ſhake off thoſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome motions that are not obedient to reaſon. The like happens to ſuch men, (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> and Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> teſtify) as it doth to thoſe that ſail into the Ocean, and the wide Sea,<note place="margin">Of the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mind of a ſolitary life. A ſimile from ſuch as are toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at Sea.</note> who deſire to come to a commodious haven they are bound for; for they are no leſſe troubled with vomitting, giddineſſe, and nauſeating in a great Ship than they are in a ſmall, for neither in the one nor the other will their deſire to vomit leave them; becauſe the ſuperfluity of choller and flegme in their ſtomachs goes along with them in both veſlels. So in changing the courſe of life, no man attains tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, unleſſe he do wholly ſhake off his affections, and manage all his actions by reaſon. Whence <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks pat to the purpoſe.<note place="margin">Ad Lucil. Epiſt. <hi>1.</hi>

Wherefore it helps nothing to paſſe over-Seas, and to go from Cities to Cities, and to take up ſometime this, ſometime that, courſe of life. If thou wilt avoid theſe things that preſſe thee, be not elſewhere, but be another man, that is, compoſe your own
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53844:189"/>mind, and ſhake off vicious affections by reaſon and counſel, and moderating of all your actions by prudence. For, as he ſaith,</p>

Laſtly, that people marry unequally, one that is well to one that is diſeaſed, a young man that gapes for a great portion, to ſome old woman and this is not agreeing to natural ſociety, an old man to a young maid, which cannot altogether be diſcommended, nor is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſtate and order of nature, ſince many old men are green and luſty, and can get children, which old women that are paſt childing cannot have.

Some wonder that ſo great power is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the divell and his inſtruments to vex and torment men. But God doth partly wink at thoſe hurts witches bring upon ſinfull men, and he ſuffers them to be afflicted, and in ſo doing he hath a ſufficient reaſon of his own counſell and providence, and he part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtigates the Divells and their inſtruments to rage againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have deſerved to be ſo puniſhed, and he uſeth to another end their malice to chaſtiſe wicked men. So a lying ſpirit was ſent into the mouths of all the Prophets; whereby the King <hi>Ahab,</hi> being deceived might go to the battel, wherein preſent deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made ready for him.

Theſe are called Amulets and remedies againſt witchcrafts, becauſe they drive away from man all hurtfull things.<note place="margin">Jewels have a ſecret vertue.</note> This vertue is
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53844:207"/>aſcribed to Jewels and pretious ſtones alſo, which they have not from their firſt qualities, that is, their temperament of heat, cold, moyſture, drineſſe; but by a ſpecifique vertue, and hidden quality and ſecret property: the cauſe whereof cannot at all be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
               <p>So the Loadſtone draws iron to it, Jet, and Amber draw chaff and ſtraws, the Saphir which is of a blew heavenly colour defends chaſtity. The Jacinth and Chryſolite worn upon the ring-finger, reſiſt the Plague. The Emrauld and Praſius being green ſtones, refreſheth the Heart. Erranos, that is a blew coloured ſtone, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called a Turcois, preſerves a man from falling down, and from ruine; or, if any ſuch thing happen, it keeps the body from hurt. Corall bound to the neck takes off turbulent dreams, and allays the nightly fears of Children. The Carbuncle and ſtone called Sardius, commonly called the Corncel, having this name from the red berry of the Tree called the Cornel-Tree, makes a mans heart merry, and his countenance lively, diffuſing the bloud into the body. So other Jewels have other vertues, and drive away Hobgoblins, Witches, Night-mares, and other evill ſpirits, if we will believe the Monuments of the Antients. So amongſt hearbs there are ſome that reſiſt diſeaſes,<note place="margin">Strange diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the help of plants.</note> which have much aſſinity with the vexations and tortures of the Devils. As Melancholly, Frezy, Madneſſe, Epilepſie, and moſt cruel diſeaſes that befall maids and widows from the affection of the Matrix, or when their courſes are long before they come, or they ſtay long unmarried. For by theſe fumes and black thick vapours their mind is ſo affected that they ſeem to be tormented by ſome hurtfull ſpirit, and they are perſwaded that the Devil poſſeſſeth their minds, and drives them to conceive many abſurd imaginations. Againſt this evil, firſt opening a vein in the ankle, it is good to apply ſuch wholeſome plants that can free them from theſe accidents, as are Mugwort, Savory, wild Marjoram, wild Thyme, Pennitoyal, Origa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, Clary. But amongſt hearbs which relieve afflicted minds, and keep them free from venemous vapours, that offend the brain, or from the Devil, or an imagination that ſome have of him; are Rue, Squils, (of the juice whereof there is made both an Oxymel, and Vinegar) Maſterwort, Angelica, (which is a kind of Ferula or Laſerpitium) Alyſſon or Rubia Minor (which cures the Madneſſe of Dogs, and ſuch as are bit by them, which diſeaſe is not much different from theirs who rage and are tormented by the Devil) Roſemary purgeth houſes, and a branch of this hung at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of howſes drives away devills and contagions of the Plague, as alſo Ricinus, commonly called Palma Chriſti, becauſe the leaves are like a hand opened wide. So Coral, Piony, Miſſeltoe,<note place="margin">Contrary to the Epilepſy.</note> drive away the falling ſickneſſe, either hung about the neck, or drank with Wine. Some of theſe, if any man think they may be given to drive away devills; let heatheniſh ſuperſtition, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be laid aſide, let there be no fooliſh prayers, and ſtrange words uſed, whereby ſuch as profeſſe Magical Arts are uſe to effect their Incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53844:208"/>if there be any force in plants, as we find by experience there is,<note place="margin">Plants have their effects from God.</note> you muſt remember they had it from God. For all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments and hearbs that are applyed to mens bodies, become effectual, not from themſelves, but by the bleſſing of God, and ſo they procure ſome ſafe operation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if thou determine to do any thing by the help of hearbs, truſt not ſo much to hearbs as unto God. For ſo in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of diſeaſes you ſhall come to a happy end with good ſucceſſe, otherwiſe all your endeavours are vain; and the Artiſt fails of the event, when there is no thought of God from whom all things have their being and effects, and we do not rely upon him.</p>

And of the certainty hereof no man ought to doubt, or to diſtruſt Gods promiſes, ſince the truth it ſelf that cannot lye, will faithfully perform what he hath promiſed. For God is truth; but every man is a lyar,<note place="margin">God is faithfull in his promiſes. Pſ. <hi>62.115.</hi> Rom. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> that is, God deceives no man, nor mocks him, or fruſtrates him of his hope and expectation; he is none of thoſe vain boaſters or idle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe-makers, as men are, who break their Covenants, and rend aſunder all bargains and agreements, and that find out ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile waies to elude and to free themſelves from what they ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſed: but he is ſtable, firm, conſtant, and will with the greateſt aſſurance and fidelity make good all his promiſes, and what he ſaid, he will do, he will perform.

But theſe crimes are far from the majeſty of God, for no humane paſſions fall upon him. Wherefore we muſt chiefly depend upon him in full aſſurance, all our wiſhes hopes and deſires muſt be tranſported unto him, whether dangers or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, or death and our laſt conflict come upon us.<note place="margin">In danger of life we muſt fly unto God.</note> For all things grow more tolerable by reaſon of his favour and preſence, and be they never ſo bitter and ſowre, they are thereby made ſweet.
